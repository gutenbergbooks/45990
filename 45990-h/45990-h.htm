  <h1 class='c005'>BOBBY BLAKE ON THE SCHOOL NINE</h1>
</div>

<div>
  <h2 id='chI' class='c006'>CHAPTER I<br /> <br />FLYING SNOWBALLS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Ouch!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That was a dandy!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How’s that for a straight shot?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thought you could dodge it, did you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Have a heart, fellows! I’ve got a ton of snow
down my back already.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A tumult of shouts and laughter rose into the
frosty air from a group of boys, ranging in age
from ten to twelve years, who were throwing and
dodging snowballs near the railroad station in
the little town of Clinton.</p>

<p class='c008'>Even the fact that four of the group were on
their way back to school after the Christmas holidays
was not sufficient to dampen their youthful
spirits, and the piles of snow heaped up back of
the platform had been too tempting to resist.</p>

<p class='c008'>As though moved by a single spring they had
dropped the bags they were carrying, and the
next instant the air was full of flying snowballs.
Most of them found their mark, though a few in
the excitement of the fray passed dangerously
near the station windows.</p>

<p class='c008'>Flushed and eager, the panting warriors advanced
or retreated, until a stray missile just
grazed the ear of the baggage man, who was wheeling
a load of trunks along the platform. He gave
a roar of protest, and the boys thought it was
time to stop. But they did it reluctantly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Too bad to stop right in the middle of the fun,”
said Bobby Blake, a bright wholesome boy of about
eleven years, with a frank face and merry brown
eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bailey’s got a grouch on this morning,” remarked
Fred Martin, better known among the boys
as “Ginger,” because of his red hair and equally
fiery temper.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I never saw him any other way,” put in
“Scat” Monroe, one of the village boys, who had
come down to the station to bid his friends
good-bye. “I don’t believe Bailey ever was a
boy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I guess he was—once,” said Bobby, with
the air of one making a generous concession, “but
it was so long ago that he’s forgotten all about it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Perhaps you’d be grouchy too if you came
near being hit,” ventured Betty Martin, Fred’s
sister, “especially if you weren’t getting any fun
out of it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Betty formed one of a party of girls who bad accompanied
the boys to the station to see them off.
With flushed cheeks and sparkling eyes, these girls
had stood huddled together like a flock of snowbirds,
watching the friendly scuffle and giving a
little squeal occasionally when a snowball came
too close to them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fred looked at his sister coldly. He was very
fond of Betty, but as the only boy in a large family
of girls, he felt it was incumbent on him to
maintain the dignity of the male sex. He had pronounced
ideas on the necessity of keeping girls
in their place, and Betty was something of a trial
to him because she refused to be squelched.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course, girls feel that way,” he said loftily.
“They’re afraid of the least little thing. But
men aren’t such scare-cats.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Men!” sniffed Betty scornfully. “You don’t
call yourself a man, do you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I’m going to be some day,” her brother
retorted, “and that’s more than you can say.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This was undeniable, and Fred felt that he had
scored a point.</p>

<p class='c008'>Betty was reduced to the defensive.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wouldn’t want to be,” she rejoined rather
feebly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fred cast a proud look around.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sour grapes!” he ejaculated.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then, elated by his success, he sought rather
imprudently to follow it up.</p>

<p class='c008'>“As for me,” he declared, “I wouldn’t care how
hard I was hit. I’d only laugh.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Betty saw an opening.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You wouldn’t dare let me throw one at you,”
she challenged, her eyes dancing.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fred went into pretended convulsions.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You throw!” he jeered. “A girl throw!
Why! you couldn’t hit the—the side of a house,”
he ended lamely, his invention failing.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I couldn’t, eh?” cried Betty, a little nettled.
“Well, you just stand up against that post and
see if I can’t.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Fred was somewhat startled by her prompt answer
to his taunt, but it would never do to show
the white feather.</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right,” he responded, and took up his
position, while Betty stood some twenty feet
away.</p>

<p class='c008'>The laughing group of boys and girls gathered
around her, and Bobby and Scat began to make
snowballs for Betty.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, you don’t!” cried Fred. “I know you
fellows. You’ll make soakers. Let Betty make
her own snowballs.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What do you care, if you’re so sure she can’t
hit you?” said Bobby slyly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Never you mind,” replied Fred, ignoring the
thrust. “You leave all that to Betty.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The boys desisted and Betty made her own missiles.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How many chances do I have?” she asked.
“Will you give me three shots?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Three hundred if you like,” replied her brother
grandly. “It’s all the same to me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He stiffened up sternly against the post. Somewhere
he had seen a picture of Ajax defying
the lightning, and he hoped that he looked like
that.</p>

<p class='c008'>Betty poised herself to throw, but at the last
moment her tender heart misgave her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I—I’m afraid I’ll hurt you,” she faltered.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Aw, go ahead,” urged “Mouser” Pryde, one
of the four lads who were leaving for school.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Aim right at his head,” added “Pee Wee”
Wise, another schoolmate who was to accompany
Bobby and Fred to Rockledge.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You can’t miss that red mop of his,” put in
Scat heartlessly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“N-no,” said Betty, dropping her hand to her
side. “I guess I don’t want to.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Fred scented an easy victory, but made a mistake
by not being satisfied to let well enough alone.</p>

<p class='c008'>“She knows she can’t hit me and she’s afraid
to try,” he gibed.</p>

<p class='c008'>The light of battle began to glow in Betty’s eyes,
but still she stood irresolute.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll give you a cent if you hit me,” pursued
Fred.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My! isn’t he reckless with his money?” mocked
Pee Wee.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He talks like a millionaire,” added Mouser.</p>

<p class='c008'>“A whole cent,” mused Bobby.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fred flushed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Make it a nickel, then,” he said. “And if that
isn’t enough, I’ll give you a dime,” he added, in a
final burst of generosity.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Have you got it?” Betty asked suspiciously.
She knew that Fred was usually in a state of bankruptcy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve got it all right,” retorted her brother,
“and what’s more I’m going to keep it, because
you couldn’t hit anything in a thousand years.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Whether it was the taunt or the dime or both,
Betty was spurred to action. She hesitated no
longer, but picked up a snowball and threw it at
the fair mark that Fred presented.</p>

<p class='c008'>It went wide and Fred laughed gleefully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Guess that dime stays right in my pocket,”
he chuckled.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Never mind, Betty,” encouraged Bobby.
“You were just getting the range then. Better
luck next time.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But the next shot also failed, and Fred’s mirth
became uproarious.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I might just as well have made it a dollar,” he
mocked.</p>

<p class='c008'>But his smile suddenly faded when Betty’s third
throw caught him right on the point of the nose.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fortunately the ball was not very hard. It
spread all over his face, getting into his eyes and
filling his mouth, and leaving him for the moment
blinded and sputtering.</p>

<p class='c008'>The girls gave little shrieks and the boys doubled
up with laughter, which increased as the victim
brushed away the snow and they caught sight
of his startled and sheepish face. Betty, in swift
penitence, flew to his side.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Fred!” she wailed, “I hope I didn’t hurt
you!”</p>

<p class='c008'>To do Fred justice, he was game, and after the
first moment of discomfiture he tried to smile,
though the attempt was not much of a success.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s all right, Betty,” he said. “You’re
a better shot than I thought you were. Here’s
your dime,” he added, taking the coin from his
pocket.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t want it,” replied Betty. “I’m sorry
I won it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But Fred insisted and she took it, although reluctantly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Too bad you didn’t make it a dollar, Fred,”
joked Pee Wee.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Couldn’t hit you in a thousand years, eh?”
chuckled Scat.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, cut it out, you fellows,” protested Fred.
“I didn’t dodge anyway, did I? You’ve got to
give me credit for that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That was pretty good work for short distance
shooting,” remarked Bobby Blake, molding a
snowball. “But now watch me hit that rock on
the other side of the road.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look out that you don’t hit that horse,” cautioned
Betty.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the snowball had already left Bobby’s hand.
He had thought that it would easily clear the
scraggy old horse that was jogging along drawing
a sleigh. But the aim was too low, and the snowball
hit the horse plump in the neck.</p>

<p class='c008'>The startled brute reared and plunged, and the
driver, a big hulky boy with pale eyes and a pasty
complexion, had all he could do to quiet him.</p>

<p class='c008'>He succeeded at last, and then, grasping his
whip, jumped over the side of the sleigh and came
running up to the boys, his face convulsed with
rage.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chII' class='c009'>CHAPTER II<br /> <br />A FRIEND INTERFERES</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Oh,” gasped Betty, “it’s Ap Plunkit!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” added Fred, “and he’s as mad as a hornet.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Applethwaite Plunkit was the son of a farmer
who lived a short distance out of town. He was
older and larger than the rest of the boys gathered
on the station platform, and they all disliked
him thoroughly because of his mean and ugly disposition.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bobby and Fred had had several squabbles with
him when he had attempted to bully them, but
their quarrels had never yet got to the point of
an actual fight. But just now, as he strode up to
them, it looked as though a fight were coming.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bobby was a plucky boy, and though he never
went around looking for trouble, he was always
willing and able to take his own part when it became
necessary. But Ap was a great deal bigger
and heavier than he, and just now had the advantage
of the whip. So that Bobby’s breath came a
little faster as Ap came nearer. But he never
thought of retreating, and faced the bully with an
outward calm that he was very far from feeling.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Which one of you fellows hit my horse?” demanded
Ap, in a voice that trembled with rage.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I did,” replied Bobby, stepping forward a little
in advance of the group.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What did you do it for?” cried Ap, at the same
time raising his whip.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I didn’t aim at the horse,” replied Bobby. “I
was trying to hit a rock on the other side of the
road.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t believe it,” snarled the bully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can’t help whether you believe it or not,” answered
Bobby. “It’s the truth.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You needn’t think you’re going to crawl out
of it that way,” Ap snapped back. “You hit my
horse on purpose and now I’m going to hit you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He lifted his whip higher to make good his
threat. Bobby’s fists clenched and his eyes
glowed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t you touch me with that whip, Ap Plunkit,”
he warned, “or it will be the worse for you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You bet it will!” cried Fred, rushing forward.
“You touch Bobby and we’ll all pitch into you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s what!” ejaculated Mouser.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sure thing,” added Pee Wee, who, though
lazy and hard to rouse, was always loyal to his
friends.</p>

<p class='c008'>For a moment it seemed as though a general
scrimmage could not be avoided, and the girls gave
little frightened shrieks.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ap hesitated.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Four against one,” he muttered sarcastically.
“You’re a plucky lot, you are.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Throw down that whip and any one of us will
tackle you,” cried Fred hotly, his fiery temper getting
the better of him.</p>

<p class='c008'>But just then a diversion came from a new quarter.</p>

<p class='c008'>A boy who was just about equal to Ap in age
and weight, who had a lot of freckles, a snub nose,
a jolly Irish face and a crop of red hair that
rivaled Fred’s own, pushed his way through the
crowd that had gathered.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s Pat Moriarty,” cried Betty in relief.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hello, Bobby! Hello, Fred!” called out the
newcomer cheerily. “What’s the rumpus
here?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s this Ap Plunkit,” explained Bobby. “I
hit his horse with a snowball by accident.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And the big coward’s brought his whip over
to get even,” volunteered Fred.</p>

<p class='c008'>“To git even is it,” said Pat, as his eyes fell on
the bully, who was beginning to move backward.
“Well, I’ll give him the chanst.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He went over rapidly to Ap.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why don’t you tackle a feller of your size?”
he asked scornfully. “Like me, fur instance?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You keep out of this,” muttered Ap uneasily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Keep out of it!” jeered Pat pugnaciously.
“A Moriarty never keeps out of a scrap when he
sees a big feller pickin’ on a little one.”</p>

<p class='c008'>With a sudden movement he snatched Ap’s whip
and threw it on the ground.</p>

<p class='c008'>Resentment flared up in Ap’s eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>While the two antagonists stand glaring at each
other, it may be well, for the benefit of those who
have not followed the fortunes and adventures
of Bobby Blake from the beginning, to give a brief
outline of the preceding volumes in this series.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bobby was the only child of his parents, who resided
in the little inland town of Clinton. Although
their hearts were bound up in their son,
they had been sensible enough not to spoil him,
and he had grown into a bright, manly boy, full
of fun and frolic, and a general favorite among
the boys of the town.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fred Martin, whose family lived only a few
doors away from the Blakes, was Bobby’s closest
friend and companion. The boys were very different
in temperament, and it was this very unlikeness,
perhaps, which had made them chums. Fred
had a hot temper which was constantly getting him
into scrapes, and Bobby, who was much cooler
and more self-controlled, was kept busy a good
deal of the time in getting his friend out of trouble.
They seldom had any differences between
themselves and were almost constantly together.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Blake was once suddenly called to South
America on business, and it was arranged that
Mrs. Blake should go with him. What to do with
Bobby during their absence gave them a good
many anxious moments. They finally decided to
send him to Rockledge School, of which they had
heard excellent reports, and to Bobby’s great delight,
Mr. Martin consented to let Fred go with
him.</p>

<p class='c008'>The school opened a new world for the boys.
They had to study hard, but a lot of fun was mixed
in with the work and they had many exciting adventures.
They formed warm friendships, but
there were two or three bullies in the school who
tried to make their lives burdensome. How they
finally defeated these petty tyrants and came out
on top is told in the first volume of the series,
entitled: “Bobby Blake at Rockledge School; or,
Winning the Medal of Honor.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The steamer on which Mr. Blake and his wife
had sailed was lost at sea, and for a time it was
feared that all on board had gone down with her.
Bobby was heart-broken; so when news came later
that his parents had been rescued his joy can be
imagined. The end of the spring term was near,
and Bobby and Fred accepted the invitation of one
of their schoolmates, Perry (nicknamed “Pee
Wee”) Wise, to spend part of the summer vacation
on the coast, where Perry’s father had a summer
home. There they had a splendid time.
Their most stirring adventure involved the search
for a missing boat. This is described in the second
volume of the series, entitled: “Bobby Blake
at Bass Cove; or, The Hunt for the Motor Boat
<em>Gem</em>.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They would have stayed longer at this delightful
place, had it not been for a message brought
to Bobby by an old sea captain who was a friend
of Mr. Blake. He told Bobby that his parents
were on their way home but would stop for a while
at Porto Rico, where they wanted Bobby to join
them. Bobby was wild to see his parents again,
and his joy was increased when Mr. Martin said
that he would go too and take Fred along. They
expected adventure, but got more than they bargained
for, and the story of how they were cast
away and finally picked up by the very ship on
which Bobby’s father and mother were sailing is
told in the third volume of the series, entitled:
“Bobby Blake on a Cruise; or, The Castaways of
Volcano Island.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Once more at home, the two boys were
preparing to go back to Rockledge for the fall term, when
they suddenly came into possession of a pocketbook
containing a large sum of money. A strange
series of happenings led them at last to the owner.
In the meantime, their school life was full of action,
culminating in a lively football game where
Bobby and Fred helped to defeat Belden School,
their chief rival. How well they played their part
is shown in the fourth volume of the series, entitled:
“Bobby Blake and His School Chums; or,
The Rivals of Rockledge.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The uncle of “Mouser” Pryde, one of Bobby’s
particular friends at school, owned a shooting
lodge up in the Big Woods, and he invited Mouser
to ask some of his friends up there to spend part
of the Christmas holidays. Bobby and Fred were
members of the party, and they had a glorious
time, skating, snowshoeing, fishing through the ice
and hunting. In turn, they were themselves
hunted by a big bear and had a narrow escape.
Incidentally they were fortunate enough to rescue
and bring back to his right mind a demented hunter
who proved to be Pat Moriarty’s father. How
they did this and won the everlasting gratitude of
the red-headed Irish boy is described in the fifth
volume of the series, entitled: “Bobby Blake at
Snowtop Camp; or, Winter Holidays in the Big
Woods.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Pat and Ap seemed to be trying to outstare each
other, and the rest waited in breathless silence
during this silent duel of eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>But Ap’s eyes were the first to fall before the
blaze in Pat’s.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll get even with that Bobby Blake yet,” he
mumbled, stooping to pick up his whip.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, the next time don’t bring along your
whip to help you out,” replied Bobby.</p>

<p class='c008'>“An’ when you feel like lookin’ for trouble, I
can find it for you,” added Pat. “You’ll be rememberin’,
Ap Plunkit, that I licked you once when
you gave a hot penny to a monkey, an’ I can do it
again.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was evident that Ap did remember perfectly
well the fact which Pat referred to, for he did not
seem to want to stay any longer in the Irish lad’s
vicinity. He picked up his whip, went over to the
wagon and climbed in. Then he took out his spite
by giving his nag a vicious slash and drove away.
But first he doubled up his fist and shook it at the
boys, a gesture which they answered with a derisive
shout of laughter.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think that Ap Plunkit is just horrid,” declared
Betty, with a stamp of her little foot.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t blame him for feeling a little sore,”
said Bobby, “especially before he knew I didn’t
do it on purpose. But I guess he has a grudge
against me anyway.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He was just looking for an excuse to make
trouble,” put in Fred, “and it was just like him
to bring his whip along. He never has played
fair yet.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’s got a yaller streak in him, I’m thinkin’,”
chuckled Pat, a broad smile covering his jolly face.
“I just couldn’t help buttin’ in when I seen him a
swingin’ of that whip.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You always stand up for your friends, don’t
you, Pat?” said Mouser admiringly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sure thing,” grinned Pat. “Especially when
they’re the best friends a feller ever had. I’ll
never forget what Bobby and Fred have done for
me an’ my folks.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, that was nothing,” put in Bobby hastily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nothin’!” exclaimed Pat. “It was just
everything, an’ there isn’t a day goes by in our
house but what we’re talkin’ about it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How did you happen to be Johnny-on-the-spot
this morning?” asked Bobby, anxious to change
the conversation.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I just was doin’ an errand at the grocery store
when I heard some one say that you boys were
goin’ off to school this mornin’,” answered Pat,
“an’ I dropped everything an’ came down here
on a dead run to say good-bye and wish you slathers
of luck. I guess me mother will be after wonderin’
what’s keepin’ me, an’ she a waitin’ fur the
butter an’ sugar,” he added, with a grin, “but she
won’t care when I tell her what the reason was.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wish you were going along with us, Pat,”
said Bobby, who was genuinely fond of the good-hearted
Irish boy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” drawled Pee Wee. “We’ve got a couple
of fellows up at Rockledge that I’d like to see
you handle just as you faced down Ap this morning.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If there’s any kind of a shindig, I’d sure like
to be in the thick of it,” laughed Pat. “But I’ll
trust you boys not to let them fellers do any
crowin’ over you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Right you are,” put in Mouser. “There
aren’t any of ’em that can make Bobby and Fred
lie down when they get their dander up.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, dear,” sighed Betty, as the toot of the
train’s whistle was heard up the track. “Here it
comes. I just hate to have to say good-bye to you
boys.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Never mind, Betty,” cried Bobby cheerily.
“It won’t be so very long and you’ll hear from us
every once in a while. And maybe we’ll be able
to come home for a few days at Easter.”</p>

<p class='c008'>There was a scurrying about as the boys got
their hand-baggage together and brushed the snow
from their clothes. The train had now come in
sight, and a minute later with a great rattle and
clamor and hissing of steam it drew up to the platform.</p>

<p class='c008'>“All aboard!” shouted Mouser, and the four
boys scrambled up the steps, Pee Wee as usual
bringing up the rear.</p>

<p class='c008'>They rushed up the aisle and were lucky enough
to find two vacant seats next to each other. They
turned over the back of one of them, so that two of
them could sit facing the others, and tucked away
their belongings in the racks and under the seats.
Then they threw up the windows so as to have a
last word with those they were leaving behind.</p>

<p class='c008'>The girls had their handkerchiefs out ready to
wave a good-bye, and Betty was applying hers
furtively to one of her eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hope your nose isn’t hurting you, Fred,” she
questioned, the mischief glinting out in spite of the
tears.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not a bit of it,” answered Fred hastily, as
though the subject was not to his liking.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And you’re sure you don’t need the ten
cents?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Need nothing,” declared Fred, with the magnificent
gesture of one to whom money was a trifle.
“I’ve got plenty with me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Betty drew back a little, and Scat and Pat came
along and grasped the four hands that were thrust
out to meet theirs.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good luck, fellows,” said Scat. “I hope you’ll
get on the baseball nine this spring and lay it all
over the teams you play against.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’re going to do our best,” Bobby replied.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good-bye, boys!” called out Pat. “I sure am
sorry to have you goin’. It won’t seem like the
same old place when you ain’t here no more.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good-bye, Pat!” the four shouted in chorus.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If you have any mix-up with Ap while we’re
gone, be sure to let us know,” laughed Bobby.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There won’t be any mix-up,” put in Fred.
“Not if Ap sees Pat first, there won’t.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ap will crawfish all right,” confirmed Mouser.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’s a wonder at backing out,” added Pee
Wee.</p>

<p class='c008'>The bell of the engine began to clang and the
train started slowly out of the station. The little
party left behind ran alongside until they reached
the end of the platform, shouting and waving.</p>

<p class='c008'>The travelers, with their heads far out of the
windows, waved and called in return until they
were out of sight and hearing.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Betty’s a bully girl, isn’t she, Fred?” remarked
Bobby, as they settled back in their seats.
“You’re a lucky fellow. I wish I had a sister like
her.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ye-e-s,” assented Fred, rather hesitatingly.
“Betty’s a brick. That is,” he added hastily, “as
far as any girl can be. But don’t be wishing too
hard for sisters, Bobby,” he went on darkly.
“Girls aren’t all they’re cracked up to be.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Especially when they know how to throw,”
put in Bobby, with a roguish glint in his eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fred pretended to think this remark unworthy
of an answer, but he rubbed his nose reflectively.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chIII' class='c009'>CHAPTER III<br /> <br />THE COMING STORM</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>For several minutes the boys were the least bit
quiet and subdued. There is always something
sobering in going away from home and leaving
relatives and friends behind, especially when the
parting is going to last for many months, and the
warm-hearted farewells of the group at the station
were still ringing in the boy’s ears.</p>

<p class='c008'>But it is not in boy nature to remain quiet long,
and their irrepressible spirits soon asserted themselves
and caused the young travelers to bubble
over with fun and merriment.</p>

<p class='c008'>Besides, Pee Wee and Mouser had said good-bye
to their parents the day before in their own homes,
and had been stopping over night with their school
chums in Clinton. Their depression was but for
the moment and was over the thought of leaving
behind so much fun and good will as they had
found at their chums’ home town, and they helped
Bobby and Fred to forget their feeling of homesickness.</p>

<p class='c008'>There were not many other passengers on the
train that morning, so that the boys had plenty of
room and could give vent to their feelings without
causing annoyance to others. They snatched each
other’s caps and threw them in the aisles or under
the seats, indulged in good-natured scuffling, sang
bits of the Rockledge songs and cut up “high
jinks” generally.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fred and Mouser were seized by a longing for a
drink of water at the same moment, and they had
a race to see who would get to the cooler first.
Fred won and got first drink while Mouser waited
for his turn. But Mouser got even by knocking
Fred’s elbow so that half the water was spilled
over the front of his coat.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Quit, I tell you, Mouser,” remonstrated Fred,
half choking from the effort to drink and talk at
the same time.</p>

<p class='c008'>But Mouser kept on, until suddenly Fred saw a
chance to get back at him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What does it say there?” he asked, pointing
to some words engraved on the lower part of the
cooler. “I can’t quite make the letters out from
here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mouser innocently bent over, and Fred, taking
advantage of his stooping position, tipped his
glass and sent a stream of water down his victim’s
neck.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was a startled howl from Mouser as the
cold water trickled down his spine. He straightened
up with a jerk and chased Fred down the
aisle, while Bobby and Pee Wee went into whoops
of laughter at his discomfiture.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s no way to drink water, Mouser,”
chaffed Bobby as soon as he could speak. “You
want to use your mouth instead of taking in
through the pores.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, dry up,” ejaculated Mouser, making frantic
efforts to stuff his handkerchief down his back.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’re dry enough already,” chuckled Pee
Wee. “Seems to me it’s you that needs drying
up.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You will jog my elbow, eh?” jeered Fred, who
was delighted at the success of his stratagem.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My turn will come,” grunted Mouser. “It’s
a long worm that has no turning,” he added, getting
mixed up in his proverbs.</p>

<p class='c008'>Again the boys shouted and Mouser himself,
although he tried to keep up his dignity, ended by
joining in the merriment.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the scramble for seats when they had first
boarded the train, Bobby and Fred had had the
luck to get the seat that faced forward. Mouser
and Pee Wee had to ride backward and naturally
after a while they objected.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You fellows have all the best of it,” grumbled
Pee Wee.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s all right,” retorted Fred. “That’s as
it should be. Nothing’s too good for Bobby and
me. The best people ought to have the best of
everything.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sure thing,” Bobby backed him up. “The
common people ought to be satisfied with what
they can get. You fellows ought to be glad that
we let you travel with us at all.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Those fellows just hate themselves, don’t
they?” Mouser appealed to his seat mate.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Aren’t they the modest little flowers?” agreed
Pee Wee.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What do you say to rushing them and firing
them out?” suggested Mouser.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, don’t do that,” cried Fred in mock alarm.
“Pee Wee might fall on one of us, and then there’d
be nothing left but a grease spot.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Might as well have a ton of brick on top of
you,” confirmed Bobby.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll tell you what,” grinned Pee Wee. “We’ll
draw straws for it and the fellows that get the
two longest straws get the best seats.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That would be all right and I’d be glad to do
it,” said Fred with an air of candor. “Only there
aren’t any straws handy. So we’ll have to let
things stay as they are.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You don’t get out of it that way, you old fox,”
cried Mouser. “Here’s an old letter and we’ll
make strips of paper take the place of the straws.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right,” agreed Fred, driven into the open.
“Give me the letter and I’ll make the strips and
you fellows can draw.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Will you play fair?” asked Mouser suspiciously.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fred put on an air of offended virtue.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you think I’m a crook?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know,” retorted Mouser in a most unflattering
way. “A fellow that will pour water
down my back when I’m trying to do him a favor
will do anything.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Fred looked at him sadly as though lamenting
his lack of faith, but proceeded briskly to tear the
strips. The boys drew and Bobby had the luck to
retain his seat, but Fred had to exchange with
Mouser.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s a shame to have to sit with Pee Wee,”
said Fred as he squeezed in beside the fat boy.
“He takes up two-thirds of the seat.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The conductor ought to charge him double
fare,” grinned Mouser.</p>

<p class='c008'>Pee Wee only smiled lazily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look at him,” jeered Bobby. “He looks just
like the cat that’s swallowed the canary.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It would take more than that to make Pee Wee
happy,” put in Fred. “A canary would be a
mighty slim meal for him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’d think so if you’d seen how he piled into
the buckwheat cakes this morning,” chuckled
Bobby. “Honestly, fellows, I thought that Meena
would have heart failure trying to cook them fast
enough.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I noticed that you did your part all right,”
laughed Pee Wee. “I had all I could do to get
my share of the maple syrup.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Buckwheats and maple syrup!” groaned
Mouser. “Say, fellows! stop talking about them
or you’ll make me so hungry I’ll have to bite the
woodwork.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We can do better than that,” said Fred.
“Here comes the train boy. Let’s get some candy
and peanuts.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The boys bought lavishly and munched away
contentedly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look at the way the snow’s coming down!”
exclaimed Fred, gazing out of the window.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is for a fact,” agreed Bobby.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Looks as though it had settled in for a regular
storm,” commented Mouser.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Maybe it will be a blizzard,” suggested Pee
Wee.</p>

<p class='c008'>As a matter of fact, it appeared to be that already.
The snow was falling heavily and shutting
out the view so that the boys could scarcely
see the telegraph poles at the side of the track.
A fierce wind was blowing, and in many places the
fence rails were almost covered where the snow
had drifted.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hope we won’t have any trouble in getting to
Rockledge,” remarked Fred rather apprehensively.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not so bad as that I guess,” said Bobby.
“There’s one place though, a little further on,
where the track runs through a gulch and that may
be pretty well filled up if the storm keeps on.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wonder if there’s anything to eat on the train
if we should get snowbound,” ventured Pee Wee.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Trust Pee Wee to think of his stomach the
first thing,” gibed Fred.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There isn’t any dining car on the train,” said
Mouser. “And we’re still a good way from the
station where it usually stops for lunch.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’re all right anyway as long as the candy
and peanuts hold out,” laughed Bobby.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” mourned Pee Wee, “but there isn’t
much nourishment in them when a fellow’s really
hungry.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The storm continued without abatement, and the
few passengers that got on at the way stations
looked like so many polar bears as they shook the
clinging flakes from their clothes and shoes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh well, what do we care,” concluded Pee Wee,
settling back in his seat. “There’s no use
borrowing trouble. It always comes soon enough if
it comes at all.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We ought to be used to snow by this time,”
remarked Mouser. “After what we went through
up in the Big Woods this doesn’t seem anything
at all.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Listen to the north pole explorer,” mocked
Fred. “You’d think, to hear him talk, that he’d
been up with Cook or Peary.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I’ve got it all over those fellows in one
way,” maintained Mouser. “I’ll bet they never
had a snowslide come down and cover the shack
they were living in.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That was a close shave all right,” said Bobby
a little soberly, as he thought of what had been
almost a tragedy during their recent holiday at
Snowtop Camp. “I thought once we were never
going to get out of that scrape alive.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It was almost as bad when we were chased
by the bear,” put in Fred. “We did some good
little running that day all right. I thought my
breath would never come back.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And the running wouldn’t have done us any
good if it hadn’t been for good old Don,” added
Mouser. “How that old dog did stand up to the
bear.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He got some fierce old digs from the bear’s
claws while he was doing it,” said Bobby.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He got over them all right,” affirmed Mouser.
“I got a letter from my uncle a couple of days
ago, and he says that Don is as good as he ever
was.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The train for some time past had been going
more and more slowly. Suddenly it came to a
halt, although there was no station in sight. It
backed up for perhaps three hundred feet, put on
all steam and again rushed forward only to come
to an abrupt stop with a jerk that almost threw
the boys out of their seats.</p>

<p class='c008'>They looked at each other in consternation.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chIV' class='c009'>CHAPTER IV<br /> <br />HELD UP</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Once more, as though unwilling to admit that it
was conquered, the train backed up and then made
a forward dash. But the result was the same.
The snorting monster seemed to give up the struggle,
and stood puffing and wheezing, with the steam
hissing and great volumes of smoke rising from
the stack.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’re blocked,” cried Bobby.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It must be that we’ve got to the gulch,” observed
Fred.</p>

<p class='c008'>“A pretty kettle of fish,” grumbled Pee Wee.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’re up against it for fair, I guess,” admitted
Mouser. “But let’s get out and see how bad
the trouble is.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The boys joined the procession of passengers
going down the aisle and jumped off the steps of
the car into a pile of snow beside the track that
came up to their knees. Pee Wee, who as usual
was last, lost his balance as he sprang, and went
head over heels into a drift. His laughing comrades
helped him to his feet.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wallowing like a porpoise,” grinned Fred.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You went into that snow as if you liked it,”
chuckled Bobby.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lots of sympathy from you boobs,” grumbled
Pee Wee, as he brushed the snow from his face
and hair.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lots of that in the dictionary,” sang out
Mouser. “But come ahead, fellows, and see
what’s doing.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The others waded after Mouser until they stood
abreast of the locomotive.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was a scene of wintry desolation that lay
stretched before their eyes. As far as they could
see, they could make out little but the white blanket
of snow, above which the trees tossed their black
and leafless branches. Paths and fences were
blotted out, and except for the thin column of
smoke that rose from a farmhouse half a mile
away, they might have been in an uninhabited
world of white.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Looks like Snowtop, sure enough,” muttered
Mouser, as he looked around.</p>

<p class='c008'>The conductor and the engineer, together with
the trainmen, had gathered in a little group near
the engine, and the boys edged closer in order
to hear what they were saying.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s no use,” the grizzled old engineer was remarking.
“The jig’s up as far as Seventy-three
is concerned. I tried to get the old girl to buck
the drifts, but she couldn’t do it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The boys thought it was no wonder that Seventy-three
had gone on strike, as they noted that her
cowcatcher was buried while the drift rose higher
than her stack.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s too bad,” rejoined the conductor, shaking
his head in a perplexed fashion. “I’ve been worrying
about the gulch ever since it came on to
snow so hard. It wouldn’t have mattered so
much if it hadn’t been for the wind. That’s
slacked up some now, but the damage is done already.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What are you going to do, boss?” asked one
of the trainmen.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’ll have to go back to the last station and
wire up to the Junction for them to send the snow-plough
down and clear the track,” responded the
conductor. “Get a hustle on now and ask them
to send it along in a hurry.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The trainman started back at as fast a pace as
the snow permitted, and the engineer climbed back
into his cab to get out of the wind while waiting
for help. The conductor started back for the
smoking car, and as he went past, Bobby ventured
to speak to him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How long do you think we’ll have to wait
here?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No telling, sonny,” the conductor answered.
“Perhaps a couple of hours, maybe longer. It all
depends on how soon they can get that snow-plough
down to us.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He passed on and Mouser gave a low whistle.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Scubbity-<em>yow</em>!” cried Fred, giving vent to his
favorite exclamation. “Two long hours in this
neck of the woods!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And nothing to eat in sight,” groaned Pee
Wee.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wish I’d let Meena put up that lunch for us
this morning,” said Bobby regretfully. “My
mother wanted me to bring one along, but I was in
a hurry and counted on getting something to eat
at the railroad lunch station.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What are we going to do?” moaned Pee Wee.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Fill up on snowballs,” suggested Mouser
heartlessly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Pee Wee glared at him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m almost as bad as Pee Wee,” said Fred.
“I feel as empty as though I hadn’t had anything
to eat for a week. I could eat the bark off a tree.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I tell you what, fellows,” suggested Bobby,
who was usually the leader when it came to action;
“what do you say to going over to that
farmhouse and trying to buy something to eat? I
don’t think they’d let us go away hungry.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They followed the direction of his pointing
finger, and new hope sprang up in them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But it’s an awful long way off,” objected Pee
Wee, whose fear of exertion was only second to his
love of eating.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Have you got another stone bruise on your
foot?” asked Mouser sarcastically.</p>

<p class='c008'>This was a standing joke among the boys.
Whenever Pee Wee hung back from a walk or a
run, he usually put forth the excuse of a stone
bruise that made him lame for the time.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, I haven’t any stone bruise,” Pee Wee
rapped back at him, “but how do you know I
didn’t bark my shins when I had that tumble a
few minutes ago?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He put on a pained look which might have deceived
those who did not know him so well. But
the steady stare of his comrades was too much for
him to stand without wilting, and he had to join
rather sheepishly in the laugh that followed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You stay here then, Pee Wee, while we go
over and get something to eat,” suggested Fred.
“We’ll ask the farmer to bring you over something
on a gold tray. He’ll be glad to do it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, cut it out,” grinned Pee Wee. “Go ahead
and I’ll follow.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Foxy boy, isn’t he?” chuckled Fred. “He
wants us to break out the path so that it will be
easier for him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’d rather have Pee Wee go ahead,” remarked
Mouser. “He’d be better than any snow plough.”</p>

<p class='c008'>With chaff and laughter they started out, Bobby
leading the way and the rest following in single
file. They had pulled their caps down over their
ears and buttoned their coats tightly about their
necks. Luckily for them the wind had moderated,
although the snow still kept falling, but more
lightly than before.</p>

<p class='c008'>They did not do much talking, for they needed
all their breath to make their way through the
drifts. As they had no path to guide them, they
made straight across the fields, bumping every
now and then into a fence that they had to climb.
They were pretty well winded and panting hard
when at last they reached the fence that bounded
the spacious dooryard in front of the farmhouse.</p>

<p class='c008'>A big black dog came bounding down to the
gate barking ferociously. The boys took comfort
from the fact that the fence was high and that the
dog was too big and heavy to leap over it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’s glad to see us—I don’t think,” said Fred.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Seems to have a sweet disposition,” muttered
Pee Wee.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let Mouser get to talking to him,” suggested
Bobby. “He’ll tame him down in no time.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mouser, somewhat flattered, stepped forward.
He had gained his nickname because he had a
number of mice which he had taught to do all sorts
of clever tricks. His fondness extended to all
animals, and he had the remarkable power over
them with which some people are gifted. No matter
how savage or frightened they might be, they
seemed to yield to his charm.</p>

<p class='c008'>It did not fail him now. He muttered some
words soothingly to the dog, whose barking grew
feebler. Soon it stopped altogether, and in another
minute or two the brute was wagging his
tail and poking his muzzle through the rails of the
fence for Mouser to pat him.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was almost uncanny, and the boys held their
breath as they watched the transformation.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s all right now,” said Mouser, lifting the
latch of the gate. “Come along, fellows.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gee whiz!” exclaimed Bobby. “How do you
do it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You ought to be with a circus,” said Fred in
undisguised admiration. “You’d make a dandy
lion tamer.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mouser was elated at the tribute, but accepted it
modestly enough, and led the way up to the house,
the dog prancing along with them in the most
friendly manner.</p>

<p class='c008'>As they reached the door and were about to
knock, it was opened, and a motherly looking
woman appeared on the threshold. There was
an expression of anxiety on her face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Down, Tiger, down,” she cried. Then as she
saw the evident pleasure of the brute in the boys’
company, her worried expression changed to one
of surprise.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mercy on us!” she exclaimed. “I was afraid
the dog would eat you up. He’s awfully savage,
but we keep him on account of there being so
many tramps around. I was upstairs when I
heard him barking, and I hurried down as fast as
I could, for I was sure he’d bite you if you came
inside the gate.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Tiger’s a good friend of mine, aren’t you,
Tiger?” laughed Mouser, as he stooped to caress
the dog.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tiger licked his hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I never saw anything like it,” said their
hostess. “I just can’t understand it. But here
I am keeping you standing outside when you must
be half perished with the cold,” she went on with
quick sympathy. “Come right inside and get
warm before you say another word.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She led the way into a bright, cheerful sitting
room, where there was a big wood fire blazing on
the hearth. She bustled around and saw that they
were comfortably seated before the fire. Then
Bobby explained their errand.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I suppose we’re sort of tramps ourselves,” he
said with the winning smile that always gained
for him instant liking. “But we were on the train
and it got stalled over there in the gulch on account
of the snow. We hadn’t brought any lunch
with us and we thought we’d come over here and
see if we could buy something to eat.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You poor starved boys!” she exclaimed with
as ready a sympathy as though she had been the
mother of them all. “Of course you can have all
you want to eat. It’s too early for dinner yet,
as Mr. Wilson—that’s my husband—went to town
this morning and will be a little late in getting
back. But I’ll get up something for you right
away. You just sit here and get warmed through
and I’ll have it on the table in a jiffy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t go to too much trouble,” put in Bobby.
“Anything will do.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She was off at once, and they heard the cheerful
clatter of pans and dishes in the adjoining
kitchen.</p>

<p class='c008'>The boys stretched out luxuriously before the
fire and looked at each other in silent ecstasy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Talk about luck,” murmured Mouser.</p>

<p class='c008'>“All we want to eat,” repeated Pee Wee.</p>

<p class='c008'>“She didn’t know you when she said that,”
chaffed Fred. “I don’t believe there’s enough in
the house to fill that contract.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Pee Wee will have to go some to get ahead of
me,” chimed in Bobby.</p>

<p class='c008'>A savory odor was soon wafted in from the
kitchen. Pee Wee sat bolt upright and sniffed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say, fellows! do you smell that?” he asked.
“If I’m dreaming, don’t wake me up.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s no dream,” Mouser assured him. “It’s
something a good sight more real than that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Before long the door opened to reveal the smiling
face of Mrs. Wilson.</p>

<p class='c008'>“All ready, boys,” she announced cheerily.
“Come right along.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chV' class='c009'>CHAPTER V<br /> <br />THE TRAMPS’ RETREAT</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The boys needed no second invitation. Even
Pee Wee shook off his usual laziness. With a
single impulse they sprang from their chairs and
trooped out into the dining room.</p>

<p class='c008'>It seemed to the hungry boys as though nothing
had ever looked so good as the meal that their
hostess had provided for them. There was a huge
dish of bacon and eggs, plates piled high with
snowy, puffy biscuit, which, as Mrs. Wilson told
them, she had “knocked together” in a hurry,
smoking hot from the oven, a great platter of fried
potatoes, and, to crown the feast, mince and apple
and pumpkin pies whose flaky crusts seemed to
fairly beg to be eaten.</p>

<p class='c008'>A simultaneous “ah-h” came from the boys, as
they looked at the store of good things set before
them, and the way they plunged into the meal was
the sincerest tribute that could be paid to the cookery
of their hostess. It brought a glow of pleasure
into her kindly eyes and a happy flush to her
cheeks. She fluttered about them like a hen over
her chicks, renewing the dishes, pressing them to
take more—a thing which was wholly unnecessary—and
joining in their jokes and laughter. It is
safe to say that a merrier meal had not been enjoyed
in that old farmhouse for many a day.</p>

<p class='c008'>But even a meal like that had to come to an end
at last, and it was with a sigh of perfect satisfaction
that the boys finally sat back in their chairs
and looked about at the complete wreck they had
made of the viands.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Looks as if a whirlwind had passed this way,”
remarked Mouser.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I never enjoyed a meal so much,” said Pee
Wee.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, you’re certainly a judge,” laughed Fred.
“When you say a meal’s the limit you know what
you’re talking about. And this time I agree with
you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m glad you liked things,” put in Mrs. Wilson.
“It does me good to see the way you boys
eat.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m afraid you wouldn’t make much money if
you had us as steady boarders,” smiled Bobby.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come right back to the living room and get
yourselves warm as toast before you start out
again in this wind,” urged their hostess.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’d like to ever so much,” replied Bobby.
“But I guess we’d better be getting along.
Perhaps that snow plough will get down sooner than
we thought, and everything’s been so good here
that I’m afraid perhaps we’ve stayed too long
already.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They wrapped themselves up warmly, and then
Bobby as spokesman turned to their hostess.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How much do we owe you?” he asked, taking
out his pocketbook, while the others prepared to
do the same.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You don’t owe me a cent!” declared Mrs. Wilson
with emphasis.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, but yes,” rejoined Bobby, somewhat
startled. “We couldn’t think of letting you go to
all that trouble and expense without paying for
it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I won’t take a penny, bless your hearts,” Mrs.
Wilson repeated. “It’s been a real joy to have
you here. I haven’t any children of my own, and
the old place gets a bit lonesome at times. I
haven’t had such a good time for years as I’ve
had this morning, seeing you eat so hearty and
listening to your fun. I feel that I owe you a
good deal more than you do me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She was firm in her determination, although the
boys pressed the matter as far as they could without
offending her. So they were forced at last to
yield to her wishes and return the money to their
pockets.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was with the warmest thanks that they left
their kind-hearted hostess and went down the
steps, Tiger accompanying them to the gate. He
seemed to want to go further and whined softly
when Mouser patted him good-bye.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Isn’t she a prince?” said Pee Wee admiringly,
as they waved their hands in farewell.</p>

<p class='c008'>“A princess you mean,” corrected Mouser.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Have it your own way,” retorted Pee Wee.
“Whichever name’s the best, she’s that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They were in a high state of elation as they
ploughed their way across the snowy fields. They
were blissfully conscious of being, as Mouser put
it, “full to the chin,” and little else was needed
at their age to make their happiness complete.</p>

<p class='c008'>But they were sharply awakened by the sound
of a whistle.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That must be our train,” cried Fred in alarm.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s what it is,” assented Bobby, quickening
his pace. “We stayed a long time at the table,
and the snow-plough must have come along sooner
than they thought it would. Hurry, fellows,
hurry!” and he tried to break into a run.</p>

<p class='c008'>The others followed his example, but the snow
was too deep for that. It clung about their feet
and legs until they felt that they were moving in
a nightmare.</p>

<p class='c008'>“She’s going, fellows!” shouted Mouser in
despair, as a stream of smoke began to stretch out
behind the moving train.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And all our bags and things are on board!”
wailed Fred.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now we’re in a pretty mess,” gasped Pee Wee,
slumping down in the snow.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was no use in hurrying now, and they
looked blankly at each other as they came to a full
stop.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Scubbity-<em>yow</em>!” howled Fred as the only way
to relieve his feelings.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I’ll be jiggered!” exclaimed Mouser.</p>

<p class='c008'>Pee Wee was too tired out from his exertion to
say anything, and Bobby, too, kept silent, though
for a different reason. He was busy thinking of
the best way to get out of the tangle.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There’s no use in worrying about our baggage,
fellows,” he said at last. “Probably the conductor
will take good care of that. And we may be
able to send a telegram from some place telling
the conductor to put our things off at Rockledge
and leave them in care of the station agent there.
What we’ve got to worry about is ourselves. We
can’t stay here, and we’ve got to find some way to
get another train as soon as we can. Have any
of you fellows got a time table?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I had one,” replied Mouser, “but it’s in my
bag on the train.”</p>

<p class='c008'>None of the others had one and Bobby came to
a quick decision.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There’s no other way,” he announced.
“We’ll have to go back and ask Mrs. Wilson.
She’ll know all about the trains and what’s the
best station for us to go to.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They trudged back rather forlornly and explained
their plight to Mrs. Wilson, who was full
of sympathy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’d like to have you stay here all night,” she
volunteered, “and Mr. Wilson will take you over
to the station in a rig to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They thanked her heartily, but explained that
this was out of the question. They would be
missed from the train, telegrams would be flying
back and forth and their parents would be anxious
and excited. They must get to some place where
they could either telegraph or, better yet, get a
train that would land them in Rockledge that afternoon
or evening.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll tell you what to do,” she suggested, as a
thought struck her. “You can’t get a train on
this line you’ve been traveling on until very late
to-night. But there’s another road that crosses
this at a junction about two miles from here and
connects with the main line that goes on to Rockledge.
There’s an afternoon train on that line
that you’ll have plenty of time to make, and it will
land you in Rockledge before night. There’s a
telegraph office there too, and you can send any
messages you like before you board the train.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s just the very thing,” cried Bobby with
enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Just what the doctor ordered,” chuckled
Mouser.</p>

<p class='c008'>She gave them very careful directions for finding
the station, and as there was none too much
time and the walking was bound to be slow they
set out at once, after thanking their friend for
having come a second time to their relief.</p>

<p class='c008'>Their path led for the most part through a wood
and they passed no other houses on their way.
Even in summer it was evident that the locality
was wild and deserted. Now with the snow over
everything it was especially desolate.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You might almost think you were up in the
Big Woods,” commented Mouser.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s what,” agreed Fred. “It would be a
dandy place for train robbers and that kind of
fellows.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’d hate to be wandering around here at
night,” remarked Pee Wee, who was panting with
the exertion of keeping up with the others.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It would give one a sort of creepy feeling, like
being in a cemetery,” assented Bobby.</p>

<p class='c008'>Suddenly Fred uttered an exclamation.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There’s a little house right over in that hollow,”
he cried, pointing to the right.</p>

<p class='c008'>“More like a hut or a shack than a regular
house, seems to me,” grunted Mouser.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t believe there’s any one living there,”
commented Pee Wee.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, there must be,” declared Bobby. “I can
see the light of a fire shining through the window.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The hut in question was a dilapidated structure
of only one story that stood in a little hollow just
off the road. It was in the last stages of decay
and looked as though a strong wind would blow it
to pieces. There were no fences nor barn nor
any wagon or farm implement in sight.</p>

<p class='c008'>Yet that some one lived in the crazy shack was
evident, as Bobby had said, by the red light that
came flickeringly through the only window that
the cabin possessed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let’s stop there for a minute and get warm,”
suggested Fred. “Then, too, we can make sure
that we’re still on the right road to the station.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s the use?” cautioned Bobby. “We got
left once to-day by stopping too long.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It will only take a minute,” urged Fred.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the others also wanted to stop, and Bobby
did not wish to insist too much, they all went down
into the hollow together.</p>

<p class='c008'>The snow of course deadened their footsteps, so
that whoever was in the cabin had no notice of
their approach.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fred, who was in advance, rapped on the door.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was silence for a moment and then the
door swung open and a rough looking man appeared
on the sill.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What do you want?” he asked gruffly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We wanted to ask directions about the road,”
said Fred, a little dismayed by the fellow’s surly
manner.</p>

<p class='c008'>The man looked them over for a moment, noticed
that they were well dressed and hesitated no
longer.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come in,” he said briefly, and stood aside for
them to pass.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chVI' class='c009'>CHAPTER VI<br /> <br />HEAVY ODDS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Although feeling rather uneasy because of the
man’s rough manner, the boys hardly saw what
they could do but accept the invitation, and they
went inside. The next moment they wished they
had not.</p>

<p class='c008'>There were two other men within the hut besides
the one who had opened the door. They
were seated at a bare pine table, and on the table
there was a bottle of liquor. There seemed to be
no other furniture in the miserable room, except
a rusty wood stove, which was at white heat, two
or three stools and a pile of hay in the corner,
which evidently served as a bed.</p>

<p class='c008'>The heat inside was stifling, and the room was
rank with the fumes of liquor. The unshaven
faces of the men were flushed, their eyes red and
bleared, and a greasy pack of cards told of their
occupation when they had been interrupted.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Tramps,” whispered Bobby to Fred, who was
nearest. “Let’s get out of this.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You bet,” returned Fred, as he made a motion
toward the door.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the man who had let them in now stood with
his back against the closed door, looking at them
with an ugly grin on his face, a face which was
made still more repellant by a livid scar up near
the temple.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What do these young buckos want here?”
asked one of the men at the table, rising and coming
toward them. As he did so, Bobby noticed
that he limped a trifle.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We stopped in for a minute to ask if we were
on the right road to the station,” said Bobby in
a tone which he tried to render as careless as possible.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You did, eh?” said the man. “Well, just wait
a minute and I’ll tell you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He and his companion approached their comrade
at the door, and for a few moments there was
a whispered conversation. Then the man with
the scar, who seemed to be the leader of the gang,
turned to Bobby.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re on the right road all right,” he said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thank you,” returned Bobby. “Then I guess
we’ll be getting on.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The man laughed at this.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Guess again, young feller,” said one of them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s your hurry?” asked the lame man.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We don’t often have such nice young kids drop
in to keep us company,” sneered the man with the
scar. “Take off your hats and stay awhile.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The boys’ hearts sank. They no longer had any
doubts of the evil intentions of the men who held
them virtually prisoners. They had fallen into a
den of thieves.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’re going now,” declared Bobby, in a last
desperate attempt to bluff the matter through,
“and if you try to stop us it will be the worse for
you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The men laughed uproariously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“A fine young turkey cock he is!” croaked
one of them. “We’ll have to cut his comb for
him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’ll get your own cut first,” shouted Fred,
who was blazing with anger. “Don’t forget that
there are policemen and jails for just such fellows
as you are.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Shut up, Redhead,” commanded the scar-faced
man, adding insult to injury.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then his jocular manner passed and was replaced
by a wicked snarl.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hand over what money you’ve got in your
pockets,” he commanded, “and turn your pockets
inside out. Do it quick too, or we’ll skin you
alive.”</p>

<p class='c008'>There was no mistaking the menace in his tone.
He was in deadly earnest and his eyes shone like
those of a beast of prey.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was nothing to do but to obey. His victims
were trapped and helpless. They were only
eleven year old boys, and were no match physically
even for one such burly ruffian. Against three,
resistance would have been ridiculous.</p>

<p class='c008'>Boiling with inward rage, they slowly and sullenly
handed over the contents of their pockets.
None of them had any great amount of money—only
a few dollars for spending allowance. But
taken altogether it made quite a respectable sum,
over which the robbers gloated with evident satisfaction.
Probably their chief calculation was the
amount of liquor it would buy for their spree.</p>

<p class='c008'>But even with this the thieves were not content.
Bobby’s silver watch, a scarf pin of Mouser’s,
Fred’s seal ring and Pee Wee’s gold sleeve buttons
went to swell the pile. They even carried
their meanness so far as to rob the lads of their
railroad tickets. Then when they found that there
was nothing else worth the plucking, the leader
opened the door.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now beat it,” he growled, “and thank your
lucky stars that we didn’t swipe your clothes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Half blinded with wrath, the crestfallen boys
climbed out of the hollow and into the road which
they had left in such high spirits a few minutes
before. They had been stripped clean. If their
outer clothing had fitted any of the rascals they
would have probably lost that too. They were
utterly forlorn and downhearted.</p>

<p class='c008'>If they had lost their possessions after a hot
resistance against those who were anyway near
their age and size, there would at least have been
the exhilaration of the fight. But even that poor
compensation was denied them. The odds had
been too overwhelming even to think of a struggle.</p>

<p class='c008'>At first they could not even speak to each other.
When they attempted to find words they were so
mad that they could only splutter.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The skunks!” Fred managed to get out at
last.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The low down brutes,” growled Mouser.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Every cent gone,” groaned Pee Wee. “And
those sleeve buttons were a Christmas gift from
my mother.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And that silver watch was one my father gave
me on my last birthday,” muttered Bobby thickly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If they’d only left us our railroad tickets!”
mourned Fred.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That was the dirtiest trick of all,” put in
Mouser. “You can understand why they took the
money and jewelry. But they probably don’t
have any idea in the world of using the tickets.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Likely enough by this time they’ve torn them
up and thrown them into the fire,” Pee Wee conjectured.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t speak the word, ‘fire,’” said Bobby.
“If we hadn’t seen the light of it through the window,
we wouldn’t have gone in there at all.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It was all my fault,” moaned Fred. “What
a fool stunt it was of me to want to stop there
anyway.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Bobby could easily have said, “I told you so,”
but that was not Bobby’s way.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It wasn’t anybody’s fault,” he said. “It was
just our hard luck. We might have done it a
thousand times and found only decent people there
each time.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lucky I gave that dime to Betty this morning
anyway,” grunted Fred. “That’s one thing the
thieves didn’t get.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The remark struck the boys as so comical that
they broke into laughter. It was the one thing
needed to relieve the tension. It cleared the air
and all felt better.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Talk about looking on the bright side of
things,” chuckled Pee Wee.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re a wonder as a little cheerer-up,” commented
Mouser.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s looking at the doughnut instead of seeing
only the hole in the doughnut,” laughed Bobby.</p>

<p class='c008'>After all they were alive and unharmed. The
thieves might have beaten them up or tied them
in the cabin while they made their escape.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Things might have been a great deal worse,”
said Bobby cheerfully, putting their thoughts into
words. “The money didn’t amount to so much
after all, and our folks will send us more. And
we may be able to have the tramps arrested and
get back our other things. We’ll telegraph just
as soon as we get to—”</p>

<p class='c008'>But here he stopped short in dismay.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We haven’t even money enough to pay for the
message!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Perhaps the station man will trust us,” suggested
Fred.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think there’s a way of sending messages so
that the folks who get them pay on the other end,”
said Pee Wee hopefully.</p>

<p class='c008'>None of the boys were very clear on this point,
but it offered a ray of cheer.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We won’t need to send more than one message
anyway,” said practical Bobby as they trudged
along. “Some of our folks might be away and
there might be some delay in getting to them.
But I know that my father is at home and I’ll just
ask him to send on enough money for the bunch
of us. Then you fellows can square it up with
me afterwards.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They had reached the outskirts of a village now
and the walking had become easier. They quickened
their pace and soon came in sight of the
station.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There it is!” cried Fred, and the boys broke
into a run.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chVII' class='c009'>CHAPTER VII<br /> <br />PAYING AN OLD DEBT</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>As Bobby’s watch had been the only one in the
party, the boys had not been able to keep track of
the time during the latter part of their journey,
and they were a little fearful that they might be
late for their train.</p>

<p class='c008'>They were relieved therefore to learn they were
in plenty of time. The train was not regularly
due for half an hour, and owing to the snowstorm
it would probably be an hour or more behind time.</p>

<p class='c008'>The station agent at Roseville, as the town was
named, had charge of the telegraph office as well.
He was a kindly man and listened with the greatest
sympathy to the boys’ story. His indignation
at the robbers was hot, and he promised to put the
constable on their trail at once.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s a beastly outrage,” he stormed. “That
old deserted shack has been too handy for fellows
of that kind. They make it a regular hang-out.
We’ll clean out the gang and burn the place to
the ground. I’ve got to stay here now until after
the train leaves, but as soon as it’s gone, I’ll get
busy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He assured them that he would send on the telegram
to be paid for at the other end, and the boys,
possessing themselves of some blanks, withdrew to
a quiet corner to prepare the message.</p>

<p class='c008'>It proved to be a matter requiring some thought,
and several blanks were cast aside before it suited
them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You see,” said Bobby, as he sat frowning over
his stub of a pencil, “I don’t want to scare the
folks to death by telling them we’ve been robbed.
They’d think that perhaps we’d been hurt besides
and were keeping it quiet so as not to worry ’em.
We can write ’em a letter afterward and tell ’em
all about it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The final outcome of their combined efforts
stated the matter with sufficient clearness:</p>

<p class='c010'>Lost money and tickets. All safe and sound.
Please telegraph twenty dollars to me, care station
agent, Roseville. Will explain in letter.</p>

<div class='c011'>Bobby.</div>

<p class='c012'>This suited them all, though Fred suggested that
they might save by cutting out the “please.” He
was voted down however, and the telegram was
handed through the office window and put on the
wire at once.</p>

<p class='c008'>This being attended to, there was nothing to do
but to wait. Then a new worry assailed them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How long do you think it will be before we
can get an answer?” asked Mouser.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not very long,” replied Bobby confidently.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The message must be in Clinton this very minute,”
chimed in Pee Wee.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, but that’s the least part of it,” remarked
Fred. “It will have to be carried up to your
house from the station and I’ve heard my father
say that Claxton isn’t as quick about those things
as he ought to be. Sometimes he gets Bailey to
deliver for him, and you know what an old slow-poke
he is.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And even when it gets to the house your father
may be downtown and your mother may be out
sleigh riding or visiting or something,” observed
Mouser gloomily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And then too, it will take some time for your
father to get down to the telegraph office and send
the money,” was Pee Wee’s contribution.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, stop your croaking, you fellows,” cried
Bobby. “I’m sure everything will be all right.”
But, just the same, their doleful suggestions made
him a little uneasy, and he fidgeted about as he
watched the hands of the station clock.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There’s another thing,” observed Mouser, returning
to the charge. “Suppose now—just
suppose—that the money doesn’t get to us before the
train starts, what are we going to do?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then we’ll be stuck,” admitted Bobby. “And
we’ll have to do a whole lot more telegraphing to
Rockledge telling them that we can’t get there till
to-morrow. But even if the money is late, it’s
sure to come. We can pay for our meals and
lodging over night and won’t have to go to the
poorhouse.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lucky we got such a dandy feed at Mrs. Wilson’s
anyway,” remarked Pee Wee. “That will
keep us going until the money comes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It was mighty good of her to give us such a
meal and not charge a cent for it,” said Mouser.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Free meals for five hungry boys,” murmured
Fred.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Five!” exclaimed Pee Wee in surprise.
“Why, there were only four of us.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” replied Fred, “but you counted for
two.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Pee Wee made a rush toward him, but Fred
dodged adroitly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Just then, Mouser, who was looking out of the
station window, gave a sudden exclamation.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look here, fellows,” he cried. “See who’s
coming!”</p>

<p class='c008'>They crowded together, looking over his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, it’s Tommy Stone!” ejaculated Bobby.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He must be going back to Belden School,”
added Fred.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And that’s his father with him, I guess,” put
in Pee Wee.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tommy Stone was a boy who had played quite
a part in the lives of Bobby and Fred a few months
before. He had run away from home to go out
West to “fight Indians.” He had taken his
father’s pocketbook with him, intending to use
only enough to pay his fare and send the rest back.</p>

<p class='c008'>Unluckily for the young Indian fighter—or
rather luckily, as it turned out—he lost the pocketbook
out of the car window. Bobby and Fred
were standing by the side of the track as the train
went thundering past, and the wallet fell almost
at their feet. They picked it up and were wildly
excited when they found that it contained no less
than four hundred dollars.</p>

<p class='c008'>The boys had dreams of unlimited ice-cream
and soda water as the result of their find. Still
they and their parents made earnest effort to find
the owner, but as the days passed by and no claimant
appeared it looked as though the money would
become the boys’ property.</p>

<p class='c008'>Late in the fall, Bobby and Fred rescued a small
boy from the clutches of some larger boys who
were amusing themselves by tormenting him.
The boy turned out to be Tommy Stone. He had
been brought back after his runaway and sent to
Belden School, which was not far from Rockledge.
Tommy had heard that the boys had found a
pocketbook and suspected that it was the one that
he had lost. He made a clean breast of it, and
the money was restored to its rightful owner.
Mr. Stone wanted to reward the boys handsomely,
but their parents would not permit them to accept
a money reward, and Mr. Stone compromised by
sending them the material for a royal feast at
Rockledge.</p>

<p class='c008'>As for Tommy, he had an interview with his father,
the nature of which can be guessed at by
Tommy’s statement afterward that he could not
sit down for a week unless he had pillows under
him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He doesn’t look like an Indian killer,” laughed
Mouser.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not so that you could notice it,” chuckled Pee
Wee.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t see any scalps at his belt,” grinned
Fred.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tommy caught sight of the boys as he entered
the station, and ran forward to meet them with
exclamations of pleasure and surprise. Mr. Stone
looked curiously at the group but said nothing,
and went over to the agent’s window to buy his
son’s ticket.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What in the world are you fellows doing
here?” cried Tommy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’re just as much surprised to see you as
you are to see us,” replied Bobby, with a smile.</p>

<p class='c008'>“On your way to Belden?” inquired Fred.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yep,” answered Tommy, making a wry face,
“and I’m not any too glad, either. I’ve never
liked that school. The big fellows are all the time
taking it out on the little ones.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You ought to get your father to let you come
to Rockledge,” suggested Bobby.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then you’d be going to a real school,” remarked
Fred, who felt to the full the traditional
rivalry between Rockledge and its chief rival.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not but what we’ve got some bullies of our
own,” put in Pee Wee.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bill Bronson and Jack Jinks, for instance,”
observed Mouser.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’d like first rate to change,” admitted
Tommy, “and perhaps next year I can. But my
father has all his arrangements made now, and
I’ll have to stick it out at Belden for the rest of
this term.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is that your father over there?” asked Bobby.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Looks as though he had a good right arm,”
said Fred slyly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll bet he’s practiced with it out in the woodshed,”
put in Pee Wee.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s the price of strap oil, Tommy?” inquired
Mouser.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tommy winced a little at the chaffing. It was
evidently a painful subject.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bobby came to his rescue.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, cut it out, fellows,” he remonstrated.
“We all make mistakes sometimes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tommy flashed him a grateful look.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” he agreed. “But you can bet that I’m
not going to make the same mistake twice.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s the way to talk,” rejoined Bobby
heartily.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Stone had completed his purchase and now
strolled over to the group. He had never seen
the boys before, as the return of the pocketbook
had been made by Mr. Blake.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Some young friends of yours, Tommy?” he
asked, with a genial smile.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, sir,” Tommy answered. “They go to
Rockledge School, right on the other side of the
lake from Belden.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He introduced the boys by name, and Mr. Stone
pricked up his ears as he heard the names,
“Blake” and “Martin.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What!” he exclaimed. “Can this be the
Bobby Blake and Fred Martin who found my
pocketbook and sent it back to me?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s who they are,” replied Tommy, flushing.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Stone took the boys’ hands in both of his
and wrung them warmly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well this is a bit of luck,” he said heartily.
“I can’t tell you boys how glad I am to see you.
I’ve often wanted to lay eyes on the boys who
could find four hundred dollars and never rest
till they got the money back to the owner.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, that was nothing,” answered Bobby, who
always felt embarrassed when any one praised
him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It was the only thing to do,” added Fred, his
face getting almost as red as his hair.</p>

<p class='c008'>“All the same, there are lots of boys who would
never have said a word about it,” persisted Mr.
Stone. “I’ve always felt sorry that your folks
wouldn’t let me show my gratitude by making you
boys a present of something that would have been
worth while.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You did give us the stuff for a dandy spread.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Some spread that was too, fellows,” put in
Pee Wee. “I was in on that and it was just
scrumptious.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Trust Pee Wee to remember spreads if he
never remembers anything else,” laughed Mouser.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Stone’s eyes twinkled as he took in Pee
Wee’s generous proportions.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I’m glad if you enjoyed it,” he smiled.
“But tell me now how you boys find yourselves
here. I thought you traveled by the road that
runs through Clinton.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“So we do,” replied Bobby, and started to
relate the occurrences of the morning.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I see,” said Mr. Stone, interrupting before
Bobby had got very far into his story. “And
then you found out you could get a train on this
road and tramped over here. Well, you won’t
have long to wait now, for the train will be along
in a few minutes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But that isn’t all,” put in Fred.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No?” queried Mr. Stone. “What else is
there?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We were robbed on the way,” answered Fred.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Stone gasped and Tommy showed symptoms
of great excitement. Robbed! It was almost
as good as Indians.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chVIII' class='c009'>CHAPTER VIII<br /> <br />THE CLOUD BREAKS AWAY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Stone sank down into a seat.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Robbed!” he repeated. “Now tell me just
what you mean.”</p>

<p class='c008'>In simple words the boys told how they had been
held up and despoiled by the tramps.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Stone could hardly restrain his rage.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s the most atrocious and cowardly thing
I’ve heard of for a long time,” he ejaculated.
“To think of those scoundrels robbing you of
everything you had, even your railroad tickets!
They ought to be drawn and quartered.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The boys were rather hazy as to what drawing
and quartering involved, but they heartily agreed
with him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll have to get busy at once!” Mr. Stone exclaimed,
jumping to his feet. “There isn’t a minute
to lose. Those rascals will know that the officers
will be after them as soon as you tell your
story and they’ll be planning to clear out. They
may have started already, for all we know. I’ll
get the constable and some other men after them
and I’ll go along to do all I can to put the thieves
in jail.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But first,” he went on, “I’ll have to fix up
you boys. The train will be along in a few minutes.
I’ll get your tickets for you and give you
plenty of money besides to get on with.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve already telegraphed for money and I’m
expecting it every minute,” put in Bobby.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s all right, but we can’t take chances on
that. It may not come in time for you to catch
the train. I’ll look after the telegram if it comes
after you leave, and see that it’s sent on to you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course our folks will make this all right
with you,” said Fred who, like Bobby himself,
hated to be under any money obligation.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s understood,” assented Mr. Stone.
“I’ll send them a bill.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But from the whimsical droop at the corner of
his mouth it was evident that if the boys’ fathers
waited for a bill from Mr. Stone they would wait
a long time.</p>

<p class='c008'>He hurried over to the window of the agent’s office
and bought four additional tickets for Rockledge.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Take these and distribute them among the
other boys,” he said, as he handed them to Bobby.
“And here’s some money to get on with until you
hear from your folks,” he added, thrusting a number
of bills in his hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s awfully good of you, Mr. Stone,” replied
Bobby, as he put them in his pocket. “I don’t
know how to thank you enough. I’ll keep careful
account and see that you get it back to the last
cent.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t worry about that,” rejoined Mr. Stone.
“I’m only paying back an old debt, and even at
that I still owe you a lot. Now you boys go right
ahead and forget all your troubles. I’ll take full
charge of the answer to your telegram and see that
it gets to you all right.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’d like to stay with you until the train leaves,”
he went on, “but as I said before, every minute
is precious now if we want to have any chance to
nab those villains who robbed you. I’ll hustle
up the constable and I’ll let you know later how
we come out.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He gave Tommy a kiss and a hug, waved good-bye
to the others in a gesture that included them
all, and went out of the door. Through the window
they could see him going briskly up the village
street in a walk that was almost a run.</p>

<p class='c008'>The boys, left alone, looked gleefully at each
other.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Scubbity-<em>yow</em>!” shouted Fred, as he threw his
cap to the ceiling.</p>

<p class='c008'>“All our troubles are over now,” exulted Pee
Wee.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Isn’t he a brick?” demanded Bobby gratefully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Reminds me of the bread cast upon the waters
that our minister was talking about last Sunday,”
remarked Mouser. “He said it would come back
to you after many days, and by ginger I believe
it now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s more than bread,” gloated Pee Wee.
“It’s cake.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If Pee Wee says it’s cake, it <em>is</em> cake,” mocked
Fred. “There’s nobody knows more than he does
about things to eat.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They were now all as full of good spirits as they
had formerly been full of misery. They had found
that their cloud had a silver lining. In fact there
was not a cloud any longer. It had broken away
entirely.</p>

<p class='c008'>Their satisfaction was still greater when, a few
minutes later, they saw two sleighs sweep past the
station and take the direction that led toward the
cabin in the woods. There were three determined-looking
men in each sleigh, and among them they
recognized the stalwart figure of Mr. Stone.</p>

<p class='c008'>“They’re after them already,” cried Fred joyfully.
“Gee whiz, Tommy! your father is some
hustler.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He sure is,” assented Tommy proudly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Here’s hoping that they catch the thieves!”
exclaimed Mouser.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wouldn’t it be bully!” cried Bobby. “I sure
am crazy to get back my watch.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And my scarf pin.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And my sleeve buttons.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And my seal ring.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The boys watched the sleighs intently until they
were drawn out of sight.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What do you suppose they’ll do to the thieves
if they catch them?” wondered Bobby.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know,” said Mouser, whose notions of
legal procedure were woefully indistinct. “Hang
them, maybe.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not so bad as that,” objected Pee Wee. “But
I’ll bet they get a good long term in jail.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Perhaps they’ll be drawn and quartered, as
Mr. Stone said they ought to be,” said Fred hopefully.
“What do you suppose that means anyway,
fellows?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m not sure,” answered Bobby, “but I guess
it means to be cut up into quarters.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“They can cut them up into eighths for all I
care,” rejoined Fred vindictively. “Especially
that fellow who called me red-head.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, what if he did?” said Pee Wee mischievously.
“He only told the truth, didn’t he?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What difference does that make?” flared up
Fred, who was rather sensitive on the subject.
“You wouldn’t like to be called a pig because
you’re as fat as one, would you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Here, fellows, cut out your scrapping,”
soothed Bobby.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let’s agree that Pee Wee’s as thin as a rail
and Fred’s hair is as black as ink,” suggested
Mouser. “Then we’ll all be happy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>In the general laugh that followed, the rumpled
feathers were smoothed and all differences forgotten.</p>

<p class='c008'>A moment later the whistle of the train was
heard in the distance.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Here she comes!” cried Mouser.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m sorry that telegram hasn’t come yet,”
murmured Bobby regretfully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Guess old Bailey’s rheumatism made him slow
in getting up to the house,” suggested Fred.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, don’t let’s worry,” observed Pee Wee,
who was always ready to shunt his responsibilities
to the shoulders of somebody else. “Mr. Stone
will look after that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The boys boarded the train and sank back into
their seats with a sigh of relief. Their troubles
were over. They had been under a strain that
would have been trying even to those much older
than these eleven-year-old boys.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I never thought I’d be cheering for going back
to school,” remarked Fred. “But I’m ready to do
it now. All together, fellows:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hurrah for Rockledge!”</p>

<p class='c008'>They shouted it with a will.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chIX' class='c009'>CHAPTER IX<br /> <br />A COWARDLY TRICK</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“We seem to have this car almost all to ourselves,”
remarked Mouser, looking around.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We ought to call it the Rockledge Special,”
laughed Pee Wee.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Perhaps Tommy might object to that,” said
Bobby.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Go as far as you like,” grinned Tommy.</p>

<p class='c008'>The travel was indeed very light on that particular
day. There were only six or eight people
scattered through the car. This was due in part
to the snowstorm. Nobody would do much traveling
on such a day unless it was absolutely necessary.</p>

<p class='c008'>Half-way down the car, and on the other side of
the aisle, a very old man was seated. He was evidently
traveling alone. His hair was gray and
scanty and his face was seamed with wrinkles.
It was clear that he was very tired, and every once
in a while his head would drop on his breast in a
doze from which he would awake with a start at
any sudden jar of the train.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s too bad that such an old man should have
to be going on a journey all alone,” remarked
Bobby with quick sympathy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” agreed Fred. “He must be awful old.
He looks as if he was as much as eighty.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’s a Grand Army man too,” observed
Mouser. “You can see that from the hat he has
there up in the rack.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He may be going to visit some of his children,”
suggested Pee Wee.</p>

<p class='c008'>“More likely he’s going to the Old Soldiers’
Home,” conjectured Bobby. “You know
there is one a little way the other side of Rockledge.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll bet he could tell some mighty good stories
about the war,” said Fred.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’d like to see all that he has seen,” mused
Bobby.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Or do all that he has done,” added Mouser.
“It must be great to have been in a big war like
that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Maybe he was at Gettysburg,” guessed Pee
Wee.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Or marched with Grant or Sherman,” chimed
in Fred.</p>

<p class='c008'>Their youthful imaginations quickened as they
recalled the exciting scenes in which the veteran
might have played a part, and they had a deep
respect for him now as he sat there in his old
age and weakness.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’d almost like to go up and get him to talking,”
ventured Fred. “We might get him started
on the war. It’s all very well to read about it,
but there’s nothing like hearing from one who has
been through it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t think I would if I were you,” objected
Bobby. “He’s probably too tired to do much talking
and would rather be left alone.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“There’s another fellow going up to him now,”
replied Fred, “and I’ll bet he’ll get some good
stories out of him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He indicated a large overgrown boy who seemed
to be about fourteen years old. Up to now, he
had been seated on the other side of the aisle from
the veteran. But now he had risen and gone over
in his direction. But instead of slipping into the
seat beside him, as the boys had expected, he sat
down in the seat directly behind him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Guess again, Fred,” laughed Pee Wee good-naturedly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Everybody’s hunches go wrong sometimes,”
answered Fred defensively.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s the fellow up to anyway?” asked
Mouser, with a sudden stirring of curiosity.</p>

<p class='c008'>The newcomer seemed to have a long feather in
his hand such as is commonly used in feather
dusters. While the old man’s head drooped in a
doze, the boy reached over and tickled the back
of the old man’s neck with the tip of the feather.</p>

<p class='c008'>The veteran reached up his hand fretfully as
though to brush away a fly that was annoying him.
The boy drew back and snickered audibly.</p>

<p class='c008'>The boys looked at each other indignantly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What do you think of that?” demanded
Mouser.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Queer sense of fun some people have,” snorted
Pee Wee.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’s a cheap skate,” declared Fred angrily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He ought to have a thrashing,” exclaimed
Bobby.</p>

<p class='c008'>Several times the scene was repeated, and the
would-be joker was in high glee at the success of
his trick.</p>

<p class='c008'>At last the old man gave up the attempt to
sleep, and straightened up wearily in his seat.</p>

<p class='c008'>The joker looked around the car as though seeking
for applause, but the silly grin on his face
stiffened into a scowl as he met only contemptuous
glances.</p>

<p class='c008'>But his delicate sense of humor was not yet exhausted.
The old man rose from his seat to go to
the back of the car to get a drink of water. As
he passed the fellow’s seat, the latter reached out
the tip of his foot. The veteran tripped against
it, stumbled and had all he could do to keep from
falling by clutching the back of a seat.</p>

<p class='c008'>This was the last straw and the boys were furious.
By a common impulse they sprang out of
their seats and went quickly down the aisle to
where the fellow was sitting.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You ought to be ashamed of yourself!”
snapped Bobby.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re too mean to live!” blazed out Fred.</p>

<p class='c008'>“A fellow that’ll torment an old man like that
ought to be tarred and feathered,” blurted
Mouser.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And ridden on a rail,” finished Pee Wee.</p>

<p class='c008'>The fellow looked at them with surprise that
was mingled with alarm as he noted their wrathful
faces. He jumped up and stood with his back
toward the window.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now that they saw him at closer range, their
first impression of him was confirmed. He was
strong and muscular, but the strength of his body
was belied by the weakness of his face. It was
a thoroughly mean face, pallid and unhealthy
looking, with a loose mouth and shifty eyes that
dropped when you looked straight into them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s the matter with you boobs?” he demanded,
in a voice that he tried to make threatening.
“You’d better mind your own business.
Who asked you to butt in?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We didn’t need any asking,” replied Bobby.
“We saw what you did to that old man. You
seemed to think it was funny, but we think it’s
mean and sneaking.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And you’ve got to stop it,” put in Fred.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It will be the worse for you if you don’t,”
added Mouser.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll do just exactly what I want to do,” was
the ugly reply, “and I’d like to see you Buttinskis
stop me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll stop you quick enough,” said Bobby,
“and the first thing we’re going to do is to make
you change your seat.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, you own the car, do you? I’ve paid my
fare on this train and I’ll sit anywhere I want to.
Any one would think you were president of the
road to hear you talk.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll do something besides talk in a minute,”
Mouser came back at him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’ll you do?” jeered the bully, though his
voice now was getting unsteady as he saw that the
boys were in earnest.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fred leaned forward, snatched the fellow’s cap
from his head and threw it in a seat some distance
away.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Follow your hat and you’ll find your seat,” he
cried.</p>

<p class='c008'>The fellow started forward in a rage, but just
then the conductor came into the car. He came
forward briskly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Here, none of this!” he exclaimed. “You
boys mustn’t do any scrapping on this train. Get
back in your seats now, all of you, and behave
yourselves.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The boys slowly obeyed, although Fred, whose
fighting blood was up, had to be urged along a
little by the others.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No sense in not minding the conductor,” counseled
Bobby. “We’ve carried our point and
that’s enough.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They had indeed carried their point, for the fellow,
having regained his cap, slumped down in the
seat where Fred had thrown it, and for the rest
of the trip the old man was left in peace.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nor did the bully try to get even for his discomfiture.
But if looks could kill, the boys would
surely have been withered up by the angry glances
he shot at them from time to time.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’s a sweet specimen, isn’t he?” chuckled
Mouser.</p>

<p class='c008'>“A nice thing to have around the house,” commented
Pee Wee.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’d brighten it up on rainy days,” laughed
Bobby.</p>

<p class='c008'>“A cute little cut-up, all right,” affirmed
Fred.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’d hate to have him at Rockledge,” said
Mouser.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Perhaps he’s going there, for all we know,”
Pee Wee suggested.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hope not!” exclaimed Fred. “Bronson and
Jinks are about all we can stand as it is.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wouldn’t Bronson and Jinks be glad to have
him there?” said Bobby. “They’d be as thick
as peas in a pod in less than no time.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But further comment was cut short by the brake
man throwing open the door and shouting:</p>

<p class='c008'>“All out for Rockledge!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chX' class='c009'>CHAPTER X<br /> <br />ROCKLEDGE SCHOOL</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The boys reached instinctively for their bags.
Then they remembered that they had none, and
looked at each other with a sheepish grin on their
faces.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nothing doing in that line,” mourned Fred.
“I wonder if we’ll find them in the station.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They stepped off the platform into a crowd of
their schoolmates, who had come down to welcome
them. There they were, shouting and laughing
and all talking at once—Billy Bassett, Jimmy
Ailshine, “Sparrow” Bangs, Howell Purdy and
a host of others. They fairly mobbed the newcomers
and were for dragging them off at once
to the trolley car that ran to the school. But the
boys explained that they first had to look after
their missing baggage and they all trooped into
the station.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Haven’t we got a lot to tell you fellows!” exclaimed
Mouser. “You just wait till you hear it
all!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Caught in a snowslide,” volunteered Pee Wee.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Held up by tramps,” declared Fred.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Robbed of all we had,” added Bobby.</p>

<p class='c008'>These tantalizing bits of information only
served to whet the appetite for more. Their
friends crowded around them open-eyed, and
questions shot out at them like bullets from guns.
The boys suddenly found themselves exalted to
the rank of heroes. But they bore their honors
meekly enough, although they were almost bursting
with the feeling of their importance.</p>

<p class='c008'>They were delighted to find their missing bags
and suit-cases waiting for them. The conductor
had known the station their tickets called for, and
had left the articles in the care of the Rockledge
station agent.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was a telegram too from Mr. Blake to
Bobby. He had wired the money to Roseville and
Mr. Stone had seen to it that it was sent on to
Bobby at Rockledge. Mr. Blake’s telegram was a
lengthy one and full of anxiety. In it he told
Bobby to wire at once on his arrival at Rockledge,
which Bobby promptly did.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Stone had sent a separate telegram also on
his own account. He stated briefly that the robbers
had not yet been caught, but that the police
were busily hunting for them and hoped to get
them soon.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well,” sighed Bobby, as he folded up the
telegram, “I suppose all we can do is to watch and
wait.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wait for the watch you mean,” laughed
Mouser.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now don’t start anything like that,” grinned
Fred. “You’ll start Billy Bassett going if you
do, and I can see that he’s got a lot of conundrums
all ready to fire off at us.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who’s that talking about me?” laughed Billy,
coming forward. “Let him say it to my face.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ginger thought you’d be springing something
on us,” replied Pee Wee, “and we were getting
ready to duck.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Billy looked aggrieved.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You fellows don’t know a good riddle when
you hear one,” he remarked scornfully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How do you know?” countered Mouser.
“You never give us a chance to try. Spring a
real good one and see how quick we’ll tumble.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Billy looked dubious but took a chance.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, take this one, then,” he said. “What
is it that happens twice in a moment, once in a
minute, and not once in a thousand years.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The boys put on their thinking caps, but the
problem was beyond them, and Billy strutted
around with a triumphant look upon his face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t seem to be any too much brains in this
crowd,” he said, in a superior way.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Give us time,” pleaded Mouser.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Maybe it’s because it’s so bad and not because
it’s so good that we can’t guess it,” conjectured
Fred.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Take all the time you want,” said Billy patronizingly,
“but I guessed it as soon as I heard
it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>As they had no evidence to the contrary, they
had to take Billy’s word for this.</p>

<p class='c008'>They pondered it for several minutes, but no
answer was forthcoming.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nobody home,” taunted Billy. “You’re a
bunch of dead ones for fair.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll give it up,” said Mouser.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let’s have it, Billy,” surrendered Fred.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll be the goat,” said Bobby. “What’s the
answer?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The letter M,” crowed Billy.</p>

<p class='c008'>Disgust and discomfiture sat on the boys’ faces.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Rotten,” groaned Pee Wee.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The worst I ever heard,” grunted Fred.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wish I had a gun,” remarked Mouser.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s a mighty good one,” defended Billy.
“But what’s the use in giving you fellows something
to chew over. It’s like casting diamonds
before swine.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You mean pearls,” corrected Mouser.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I may be mistaken about the diamonds,”
Billy came back at them, “but I’m dead sure about
the swine.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The laugh that followed told Billy that he had
made a hit, and he swelled up like a pouter pigeon.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve got another good one,” he volunteered,
“a regular peach. Why is—”</p>

<p class='c008'>But here the boys fell on Billy in a body and
he was forced to hold his “peach” in reserve for
another time.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bobby by this time had finished all he had to
do in the station, and the boys gathered up their
recovered suit-cases and made a bee line for the
trolley. A car was coming, not a block away, and
they piled aboard almost before it had come to a
stop with wild clatter and hubbub. But the motorman
and conductor were used to the uproar
and the pranks of the Rockledge boys, and what
few other passengers there were smiled indulgently.</p>

<p class='c008'>Rockledge was a lively little town with good
stores and pleasant residence streets shaded by
handsome oak trees. There were gas and electric
lights, a number of churches and all the usual appurtenances
of a bustling village that hoped some
day to become a city. And not the least of the
things in which the townspeople took pride was
Rockledge School.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Raymond, the head of the school, had been
fortunate in choosing its location. He had been
able to secure, at a remarkably low price, a beautiful
private estate, whose owner had died and
whose family had moved away. There were several
buildings on the grounds and these he had
remodeled and adapted to the purposes of a school,
and he had built up an institution that was well
and favorably known in all that section of the
State.</p>

<p class='c008'>The school was select. By this is not meant that
it was in the least degree snobbish. Dr. Raymond
hated anything of that kind, and the school was
run on a purely democratic basis, with every pupil
on exactly the same level, whether his parents happened
to be rich or poor. But the doctor was a
great believer in the personal influence of teacher
over pupil, and this could not be exerted so well
if the classes were large. So the school was limited
to fifty pupils, and this limit was never exceeded.
At this figure the school was always full,
and there was usually a waiting list from which
any vacancy that might occur could be quickly
filled.</p>

<p class='c008'>The doctor himself was a scholar of high standing,
and he had surrounded himself with an efficient
staff of teachers. Discipline was firm without
being severe, and the boys were put largely
on their honor to do the right thing. There was
a society called the “Sword and Star” to which
admission could be gained only on the ground of
scholarship and good behavior.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bobby had won membership in this the year
before and had also gained the Medal of Honor
which was allotted each year to that pupil who,
in the judgment both of his teachers and school-fellows,
had stood out above all others. Fred,
who was more flighty and less inclined to study,
and whose “red-headed” disposition was always
getting him into trouble, was not yet a member
of the society, but had faithfully promised himself
that he would win membership in the term
just beginning.</p>

<p class='c008'>A ride of only a few minutes brought them close
to the school grounds and the boys prepared to get
off. Tommy Stone was to stay on the trolley car,
which ran as far as Belden School.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tommy had kept himself rather in the background
during the trip. He happened to be the
only Belden boy on the car, and, owing to the intense
rivalry between the two schools, a Belden
boy was usually as popular with the Rockledge
boys as poison ivy at a picnic party. But just
now Tommy was traveling under the protection
of Bobby and his party, and this saved him from
the horse play he would otherwise have had to
undergo.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good-bye, Tommy!” said Bobby, as he got
ready to leave the car. “Tell your father when
you write to him how much obliged we are to him
for all he has done for us. I’m going to write
him a letter myself about it to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, that’s all right,” said Tommy. “Your father
would have done the same for me if I’d been
in the same fix as you fellows were.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And tell the Belden boys that we’re going to
trim ’em good and plenty when the baseball season
begins,” laughed Mouser.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t be too sure of that,” grinned Tommy in
return. “But I’ll tell them and they’ll be all
ready for you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The boys dropped off the car, and in a few minutes
saw the school buildings looming up before
them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Scubbity-<em>yow</em>!” cried Fred, dropping his suitcase
and executing a jig. “The old place certainly
looks good to me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Seemed a long way off a few hours ago when
we didn’t have a cent to our names,” remarked
Mouser.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Looked as if we’d have to walk the ties to get
here,” laughed Pee Wee.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And think how many stone bruises you’d have
got,” suggested Bobby.</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘Barked shins,’ you mean,” corrected
Mouser. “They’re the latest thing in Pee Wee’s
collection.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The fat boy grinned. He was too happy or perhaps
too lazy to enter any protest just then.</p>

<p class='c008'>The school was beautifully located on a high
bluff overlooking Monatook Lake, a sheet of water,
nearly oval in shape. It was about ten miles
long and five miles wide at its broadest part.
There were several small islands scattered over
the lake, and, as may be imagined, these were favorite
resorts of the boys when they were permitted
to visit them.</p>

<p class='c008'>A strong fence guarded the edge of the bluff for
the entire length of the school grounds. A winding
staircase led from the top of the bluff to the
boathouse and the lake level.</p>

<p class='c008'>Just now Monatook was clothed in an icy mantle
that shone like silver under the light of the
moon which had just risen. It was a scene of
wintry splendor that gladdened the heart to look
upon.</p>

<p class='c008'>There were four buildings on the grounds. In
the main building, which was made of brick and
sandstone, the classrooms and dining-room were
located. The basement had two sections, one for
the kitchen and the other for the indoor gymnasium.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the upper floor were ranged the dormitories.
These were two in number. There were beds for
twenty boys in each one. Then there were five
separate sleeping rooms, each one designed for the
use of two boys.</p>

<p class='c008'>A little off from the main building, but connected
with it by a portico, was a roomy house in which
the doctor and his family lived, together with the
members of the teaching staff.</p>

<p class='c008'>Besides these there were a gate-keeper’s cottage,
where the servants slept, and a minor building
used for storage purposes.</p>

<p class='c008'>The grounds were skillfully laid out, and with
their well kept lawns and shaded paths formed a
very attractive campus. To supply the athletic
needs of the boys there was a football field, a baseball
diamond, and tennis and basketball courts.</p>

<p class='c008'>So that the boys who had the luck to be sent by
their parents to Rockledge School were usually
convinced before they had been there long that
their lines had fallen in pleasant places.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I suppose the first thing we’ll have to
do is to report to Dr. Raymond,” said Bobby.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’ll know that the school can go on all right
now that we’re here,” grinned Mouser.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I suppose we’ll have to let him know that we’re
on deck,” admitted Fred, “but let’s get it over in
a hurry and get some grub. I’m hungry enough
to eat nails.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Couldn’t we get something to eat first?”
asked Pee Wee wistfully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You ate enough at Mrs. Wilson’s to last for
a week, I should think,” said Bobby.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I notice that you weren’t very far behind,”
retorted Pee Wee.</p>

<p class='c008'>They trooped into the doctor’s office and found
him busy with some papers, which he laid aside
at once, however, as he stood up to greet them.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was a tall, spare man, with a clean-cut face
and kindly eyes that usually had a humorous twinkle
in them, although they could flash fire if he
caught any of the boys doing a mean or tricky
thing. He smiled cordially and shook hands with
them all.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re a little later than you expected to be,
aren’t you?” he asked. “I was looking for you
on an earlier train.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ve had a hard time getting here,” smiled
Bobby, and in a few words he told of the stirring
adventures through which the little party had
gone that day. The doctor listened intently, surprise,
indignation and sympathy in his eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It was an outrage!” he exclaimed, when Bobby
had finished, “and I will get in touch with Mr.
Stone at once and lend him any aid I can in catching
the thieves. But I am very glad and thankful
that it was only a loss of money and property.
Those rascals might have used personal violence.
I’ll telephone to-morrow to a number of different
towns, giving a description of the tramps and urging
the authorities to be on the look-out for them.
The sooner such fellows are put in jail the better.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He made notes of as many points about the robbers
as the boys could remember, especially of the
scar of one man and the limp of the other. As
to the third man, the boys were somewhat hazy.
He was just “plain tramp.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And now,” said the doctor, his eyes twinkling,
“I suppose there’s no need of asking you boys
whether you are hungry.”</p>

<p class='c008'>There was an eager assent on the part of the
other boys and a heart-felt groan from Pee Wee.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course it is long after the usual supper
hour,” smiled the doctor, “but go over to the dining-room,
find the housekeeper and tell her I want
her to give you the very best meal she knows how
to get up.”</p>

<p class='c008'>There was no need of a second injunction, and
the boys wished the head of the school good-night
and were off to hunt up the housekeeper.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Isn’t the doctor a brick?” ejaculated Mouser.
“I thought he’d keep us there half an hour or
more talking about the work for the coming term
and what he would expect of us.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’ll come later,” said Fred. “Just now
he knew that we were hungry.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s what makes him such a bully sort,”
said Bobby. “He hasn’t forgotten that he was
once a boy himself,” he added, with a happy sigh.</p>

<p class='c008'>And this, perhaps, was as high tribute as could
be paid by one of his pupils to the master of Rockledge

  <h2 id='chXI' class='c009'>CHAPTER XI<br /> <br />TOM HICKSLEY REAPPEARS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The housekeeper carried out the principal’s order
to the letter. And she did it with the better
grace because she herself was fond of the boys.
She bustled about and in a very short time, which
seemed long enough, however, to the hungry boys,
had a smoking hot meal on the table. The boys
gathered around and pitched into the good things
like so many hungry wolves, while the housekeeper
watched them with a genial smile on her good-natured
face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Some feed,” pronounced Fred, with a sigh of
satisfaction, when at last they were through.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ve had a tough day in some ways,” declared
Pee Wee, “but a mighty lucky one in another.
Just think of the three cooks we’ve come
up against. Meena for breakfast, Mrs. Wilson
for dinner, and Mary here for supper. Yum-yum!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sounds as if you were a cannibal,” commented
Mouser, with a grin.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Pee Wee hasn’t got to that yet,” mocked
Fred, “but there’s no telling when he will if that
appetite of his holds out.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’d hate to be out on a raft with Pee Wee in
the middle of the ocean, if we were short of grub,”
chuckled Mouser. “Just think of the hungry
looks he’d be throwing at me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’d like nothing better than to have Pee Wee
along,” put in Bobby. “We could live off him for
a month.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The chaff flew back and forth for a while, and
then the call of sleep began to make itself felt.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bobby yawned and reached for his watch.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wonder what time—” he began, and then
stopped short in chagrin.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No use, Bobby,” said Mouser. “The chances
are that you’ll never see that watch again.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Maybe it’s in some pawnshop by this time,”
was the cold comfort that Fred had to offer.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No loss without some gain,” chimed in Pee
Wee. “I won’t have the trouble of unfastening
my sleeve buttons anyway.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s looking on the bright side of things all
right,” laughed Bobby. “Come along, fellows,
and let’s get to bed.”</p>

<p class='c008'>There was no dissenting voice, and they made
their way upstairs to the old familiar dormitory.</p>

<p class='c008'>This was one of the brightest and most cheerful
rooms in the school and not the least of its charm
was that it commanded a splendid view of the lake.
There was ample space for the twenty beds that
the room contained. A locker stood beside each
bed for the exclusive use of the occupant, and
there was a chair at the head of each bed on which
the regulations of the school demanded that clothing
should be carefully folded and arranged each
night upon retiring.</p>

<p class='c008'>Most of the boys had already arrived for the
beginning of the term, and the room was full of
noise and the clatter of tongues. Later on, a little
more quiet would be insisted upon, but the regular
school course was not in full swing yet and
the boys were allowed a little more latitude than
usual.</p>

<p class='c008'>The other occupants of the room clustered instantly
about Bobby and his party, who were general
favorites. They had already learned almost
all there was to be told about the adventures of the
day, but they were keenly interested in the exploits
of the party during their winter holiday in
the Big Woods.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Shiner”—the nickname that had been bestowed
on Jimmy Ailshine—Howell Purdy and
“Sparrow” Bangs, had also been on that memorable
trip, but as they too had reached school
but a little earlier in the day, they had been able
to tell only enough of their adventures to whet
the appetite for more. The newcomers were
pleased at this, as they had feared that all the wind
would be taken out of their sails and that the trip
would be an old story when they arrived upon the
scene.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sparrow says that you killed a big bear up in
the woods,” said Sam Thompson, one of the
younger boys.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And to hear Sparrow tell it, it must have been
a twenty-foot bear at least,” laughed Frank Durrock.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No,” grinned Fred. “It had only four feet,
just like any other bear.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Smarty!” Frank shot back at him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But it seemed like twenty feet when he reared
up at us,” explained Bobby.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He was an old sockdolager, all right,” added
Mouser.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t want to see any bear so close again,”
remarked Pee Wee.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve seen him in my sleep once or twice since,”
said Fred, “and I’ve waked up all in a sweat.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Just which one of you was it that killed it?”
asked Sam, his eyes as big as saucers.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s something we can’t tell,” answered
Bobby. “We all fired at it, but I guess it was
Gid Harple, the guide, who did the trick. He was
a dandy shot, all right.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gid’s going to fix up the claws and teeth and
send ’em down to us,” said Mouser. “Then you
can see for yourself just what a big fellow that
bear was.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I heard that you had a shot at a wildcat too,”
put in “Skeets” Brody.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” said Fred, “and that was a fool stunt
too. We didn’t have much chance of getting him,
and that left our guns empty when we saw the bear
the first time. My! but we had a run for it that
day. Talk about a Marathon!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How did Pee Wee manage to make it?” asked
Frank skeptically. “I can’t imagine him putting
on speed.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Pee Wee wasn’t with us that time,” explained
Bobby. “The rest of the fellows walked down to
the station, but Pee Wee came behind in the sleigh
with Gid.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I had more sense than the rest of the gang,”
put in Pee Wee, with a superior air.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hear you got a lot of muskrats by stunning
them through the ice,” said Skeets. “How did
you make out with training them, Mouser?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not very well,” confessed Mouser. “They’re
too wild. Gid said I couldn’t train ’em, and I
guess he knew what he was talking about.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The finding of Pat’s father in the little shack,
and the story of the hunting lodge, completely
buried in the big snowslide, and the great fight
they had to get out alive were also subjects of
which their audience could not have enough. The
listeners kept clamoring for more details and still
more, until in sheer self-defense the boys had to
call a halt.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Have a heart, fellows,” said Bobby. “I’m so
dead tired that I can hardly keep my eyes open.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” added Fred, “we’ll have all the term
to tell you about the rest of it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Their hearers had to be content with this, and
in a few moments more the boys had undressed
and were in bed. But it is safe to say that in their
dreams that night enough bears and wildcats were
seen to stock a menagerie.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say, Fred,” was Bobby’s last remark that
night, as he slipped between the sheets, “isn’t it
bully to be back in the old dormitory again? Just
suppose the tramps had tied us up in that old
shack while they slipped out and left us there.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ugh!” shuddered Fred, as he snuggled still
deeper in his bed. “It gives me the cold shivers
just to think of it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was a hard thing for the boys to get out of
their warm beds when the rising bell sounded the
next morning. But there was no help for it, and
they washed and dressed in a hurry, cheered by
the thought of breakfast waiting for them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Several tables were spread in the large bright
dining-room. One of them was reserved for Dr.
Raymond and his family, together with the head
teachers. The boys were ranged about the others,
with a junior instructor sitting at the head of each
to keep order. But his duties were light, for the
boys were so intent upon dispatching their food
that they had little time left for mischief. Each
kept a wary eye on his plate, however, for special
dainties had a way sometimes of vanishing mysteriously,
and “eternal vigilance” was the price
of pie.</p>

<p class='c008'>The morning was frosty but sunny, and after
they had finished their meal, the boys lost no time
in getting outdoors. There was little to be done
on the first day except to gather in the classrooms
for a few minutes and have their lessons assigned
for the following day.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Any new fellows here this term, Skeets?”
Bobby asked, as the latter strolled with him and
Fred on the hard snowy path in front of the main
building.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Two or three came in yesterday, I heard,” answered
Skeets, “but I’ve only met one of them so
far. His name’s Tom Hicksley.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What kind of fellow does he seem to be?”
asked Fred.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t care for him very much,” replied
Skeets. “That is, judging by his looks. But you
can’t always tell by that. There he is now,” he
added, as a boy approached them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fred and Bobby looked first at the newcomer
and then at each other.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My! it’s the fellow we squelched for teasing
the old soldier on the train!” gasped Bobby.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXII' class='c009'>CHAPTER XII<br /> <br />A NEW ENEMY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Tom Hicksley had caught sight of the three
boys at the same moment, and from the spiteful
look that came into his small eyes it was clear that
he recognized Bobby and Fred.</p>

<p class='c008'>The boys looked at him coldly but did not speak,
and Hicksley, on his part, seemed at first as
though he were going to pass them without saying
anything. But the events of the evening before
still rankled in him, and he suddenly stopped.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So you’re the butt-ins that mixed up in my
affairs last night, are you?” he asked, in a tone
that he tried to make sarcastic.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fred flared up at once.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, we did,” he shot out; “and we’d do it
again if we saw you up to your mean tricks. You
can’t do anything of that kind while we’re around
and expect to get away with it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hello! what’s the fuss about?” asked Skeets,
with sudden interest.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You shut up!” commanded Hicksley. “This
isn’t any of your funeral. I’m talking to these
two boobs here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t tell me to shut up!” cried Skeets, who
had a hair trigger temper very much like Fred’s
own.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll tell you anything I like,” retorted Hicksley,
who seemed to be a master in the “gentle art
of making enemies.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll tell you what it was, Skeets,” said Bobby.
“I don’t wonder that he’s so ashamed of it that
he doesn’t want it talked about. We saw him
teasing an old soldier—a real old man, mind you—who
was trying to get a little sleep. Then when
the old man went up the aisle to get some water,
this fellow stuck out his foot and tried to trip
him up. The man had all he could do to keep
from falling. That was too much for us fellows
and we made him stop.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He ought to have had his head knocked off,”
growled Skeets.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It would take more than you fellows to knock
my head off,” returned Hicksley belligerently.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’d probably get along as well without it
as with it,” retorted Fred. “We knocked your
cap off anyway, and I notice that you changed
your seat just as we told you to.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That was because the conductor came along,”
replied Hicksley. “And it’s a mighty good thing
for you that he did. If he hadn’t I’d have knocked
you into the middle of next week.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You couldn’t knock me into to-morrow, let
alone the middle of next week,” returned Fred,
who was now thoroughly aroused.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come, come, Fred,” said Bobby soothingly.
“There’s no use in getting into a temper about
this fellow. He isn’t worth it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll show you whether I’m worth it or not,”
cried Hicksley, in a rage. “Don’t you think for
a minute that you’ve heard the last of this. There
were four of you fellows last night, and there are
three of you now. But I’ll catch each one of you
alone some time, and I’ll tan each one of you
within an inch of your life.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’d better try it,” answered Fred. “You’d
be afraid to tackle a live one. All you’re good for
is to torment a helpless old man. You’re a nice
fellow, you are.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The quarrel, although it was none of the boys’
seeking, was growing so hot that it was perhaps
just as well that Mr. Carrier, one of the teachers,
should come walking briskly along just at that moment.
He saw from their flushed faces that something
unpleasant was in the wind, but thought it
just as well to ignore it rather than give it importance
by taking notice of it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good morning, boys,” he called cordially.
“It’s just about time for meeting in the main hall.
I’m going over there now, and you’d better come
along with me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This put an end to the threatening trouble for
the time, and the boys followed along in his wake,
Hicksley some distance behind the other three and
muttering threats under his breath.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Isn’t he a pippin?” said Bobby, in a low voice,
so that Mr. Carrier could not hear.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Looks to me like something that the cat
brought in,” grumbled Fred, whose rumpled feathers
took some time for smoothing.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’s going around looking for trouble,” observed
Skeets; “and that kind is sure to find it
before very long.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No decent fellow will want to have anything
to do with him,” remarked Fred.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Except perhaps Bill Bronson and Jack Jinks,”
amended Bobby. “He’ll be just nuts for them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I said <em>decent</em> fellow,” repeated Fred.</p>

<p class='c008'>They soon reached the main assembly room into
which the boys were streaming from all directions.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Raymond and the rest of the teaching staff
were seated on a platform in the front of the room.
When the gathering had subsided into silence, the
principal rose and gave the boys a little informal
talk about the duties of the coming term and the
spirit in which he hoped they would go about their
work. He dwelt especially on the incentives offered
them to become members of the “Sword and
Star,” the main society of the school, and as he
mentioned the name of the society, the boys who
were members jumped to their feet and gave the
society yell:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c013'  >
    <div>“One, two, three—<em>boom!</em></div>
    <div>Boom Z-z-z-ah!</div>
    <div>Rockledge! Rockledge!</div>
    <div>Sword and Star!</div>
    <div>Who’s on top?</div>
    <div>We sure are—</div>
    <div><em>Rock</em>-ledge!”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The hearty shout brought a flush of pleasure
into the doctor’s cheeks and he looked around upon
his charges with a face beaming with pride. He
concluded his talk with an urgent invitation to
each of the boys to strive for the Medal of Honor,
the highest prize within the gift of the school, and
then dismissed them to their respective classes.</p>

<p class='c008'>Here the proceedings were brief. The tasks for
the following day were assigned and then the boys
were left to their own devices until the hours set
aside that afternoon and evening for preparing
their lessons.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Our soft snap is nearly over,” mourned Fred.
“From now on it will be steady work until the
end of the term.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But think how much fun we’ll have in between,”
comforted Bobby. “I’ve got a hunch
that we’re going to have the bulliest time at Rockledge
that we’ve ever had yet.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What makes you think that?” asked Fred pessimistically.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I said it was a hunch, didn’t I?” demanded
Bobby. “You don’t have to explain a hunch.
You just have it and that’s all there is to it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hate to think of buckling down to work
again,” said Fred. “We had such a bully free
time up in the woods that I wish it would last forever.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s all the more reason you ought to be
willing to work when the time comes,” remonstrated
Bobby. “Think of the poor fellows that
never have any outings and have to work hard all
the time.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I suppose you’re right,” conceded Fred. “I
don’t know just what it is that makes me feel that
way. It wasn’t so when I got up this morning.
I’ll tell you just what I think it is,” he said, as a
sudden explanation of his mood suggested itself
to him. “I’ll bet it’s that Tom Hicksley. I
wanted to get a crack at him this morning when
Mr. Carrier came along and stopped us. I’d have
felt better if I’d lit out at him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now, Fred, cut out that fighting talk,” said
Bobby impatiently. “There’s nothing in it.
What’s the use of getting into a row that will make
your folks feel bad when they hear of it and perhaps
bring you up before the doctor?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I notice that you’re ready enough to fight
sometimes,” grumbled Fred in self-defense.
“You’d have pitched into Ap Plunkit if he’d hit
you with that whip yesterday morning, and you
were all worked up on the train at Hicksley.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s a very different thing from looking for
trouble,” said Bobby stoutly. “It’s all right to
take your own part when people try to bully or
strike you. But it’s always best to keep out of a
fight unless you’re forced into it. There wasn’t
really any reason to fight Tom Hicksley this morning,
and you know it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Perhaps if you had hair as red as mine you
wouldn’t find it so easy to keep your temper,”
said Fred, falling back on an excuse he was fond
of using.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Maybe not,” laughed Bobby, “but you can
make a try at it anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s this I hear about fighting?” said
Frank Durrock, as he came up behind them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank was larger and older than the two boys,
and a prime favorite with them. He held the post
of captain of the school. This carried with it no
official power, as that rested wholly with the
teachers. But Frank was supposed to have a general
oversight, stop any disorder that went too far and
in general to act as a sort of big brother to the
younger boys.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was a fine athlete also, and had been captain
of the football team on which Bobby and
Fred had played the preceding fall and which had
won the Thanksgiving game from Belden. His
skill in baseball was also marked, and he was expected
to play first base on the nine in the spring.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Fred was feeling a little sore over a row
he had with Hicksley this morning,” explained
Bobby.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That new fellow?” asked Durrock. “I passed
him a little while ago and he was talking with
Bronson and Jinks. They seemed to be quite
chummy together.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What did I tell you?” cried Fred to Bobby.
“I knew those fellows would get together as sure
as shooting.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“They’re three of a kind,” assented Bobby.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know anything about what kind of
fellow he is,” remarked Frank, “but somebody
was telling me that he was a good baseball player.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The boys did not think it was worth while to tell
what they knew of Hicksley and so kept quiet.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’s big and husky and ought to make a good
slugger,” continued Frank, “and we can’t have
too much batting strength on our nine. So if he
can field as well as bat, he may be able to get a
place on the team.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The prospect was not at all pleasing to Bobby
and Fred, but above everything else they were
loyal to the school, and if the newcomer would be
a help to the Rockledge nine they were perfectly
willing to forget their own feeling.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So you see, Fred,” continued Frank, “you
don’t want to hold any grudge you may have
against Hicksley. I don’t know what your scrap
was about and I don’t want to know, but whatever
it is, forget it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sure I will,” said Fred heartily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You know how it was on the football team,”
went on Frank. “There were fellows on that
team that you didn’t like—Jinks, for instance—but
you overlooked that feeling and played good
football just the same. And we want to do the
same thing on the nine.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m especially anxious to get up a strong nine
this year,” he continued, “because we’re going
to have some pretty nifty teams against us. Belden
has got two or three new fellows that they say
are crackerjacks and they’ll give us all we want
to do to beat ’em.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then, too, we’re going to have a little different
scheme this season than we ever had before.
While you hunters have been up in the woods
shooting bears”—here he grinned—“I’ve been
hustling around with a few others and organized
a new league.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A new league!” exclaimed Bobby and Fred in
the same breath.</p>

<p class='c008'>“A new league!” repeated Skeets Brody and
Sparrow Bangs, who had come up just in time to
hear the last words. “What do you mean, Frank?
Tell us all about it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They gathered about him, their eyes glistening.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXIII' class='c009'>CHAPTER XIII<br /> <br />THE MONATOOK LAKE LEAGUE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Now, now, don’t all get excited,” admonished
Frank, who, all the same, was immensely delighted
with the sensation he had stirred up by his announcement.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t keep us waiting, Frank,” pleaded Fred,
who would rather play baseball at any time than
eat.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Out with it, like a good fellow,” chimed in
Bobby, whose pitching had won a game from Belden
the previous term.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank, with the instinct of the true story teller,
waited until he had got his audience worked up to
the proper pitch. Then when they were on edge,
he proceeded:</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s this way,” he explained. “Up to now
we’ve been going on in a kind of rut. Belden is
about the only team we’ve ever played any real
games with, and that hasn’t given us enough practice.
We’ve had our own scrub nine to practice
with, but as a rule they’ve been so easy that we
haven’t had to work hard enough to win. The
only way we can learn to hit different kinds of
pitching is to come up against nines that give us
a stiff fight to win.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But we have played with village nines sometimes,”
interrupted Fred.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We played the Benton team last year and beat
them six to five,” reminded Bobby.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, I know,” admitted Frank; “but those
were only single games, and there wasn’t enough
at stake. It didn’t make much difference whether
we won from them or not as long as we put it all
over Belden.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now, don’t you see how much more exciting it
would be to have several different teams, all members
of one league, each one playing the other a
certain number of games, each one fighting hard
for every game and each team working its head
off to get the pennant, which would be given to
the nine that had won the most games at the end
of the season?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The boys broke into a chorus of delighted exclamations.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That would be bully!” cried Bobby.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It would be a regular see-saw!” exclaimed
Fred. “First one team would be in the lead and
then the other. It would be a rattling hard fight
all the way from the start of the season to the
finish.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s a corker,” agreed Skeets.</p>

<p class='c008'>“A pippin of a scheme,” declared Sparrow with
emphasis.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I thought you fellows would like it,” said
Frank, much pleased at the enthusiastic reception
of his plan. “I talked it over with Dr. Raymond,
and he said that he saw no objection to it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The doc’s a good old sport,” commented Fred.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And Dr. Raymond saw the head of the Belden
school and he agreed to it too,” continued Frank,
“while the captain of the Belden nine is fairly
daffy over it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How many clubs are there to be in the
league?” asked Bobby.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We decided that four would be enough,” answered
Frank. “You see, we have only Saturdays
to play, and if we had too many clubs in the
league we couldn’t play enough games to really
make the thing go. But with four teams, each can
play three games with every other team and that
would give us a pretty good line on the strength
of each nine.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Every team would play nine games altogether,
then,” figured Fred.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, and that would take nine Saturdays. Allowing
for some days when it might be too rainy
to play that will just about cover the playing season
before school closes for the summer.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who are to be the other two nines besides
Belden and ourselves?” asked Sparrow.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ve been scouting around and have found
two town nines that will be glad to go in with us,”
answered Frank. “One is at Somerset and the
other at Ridgefield. They’re all within a few
miles so that we wouldn’t have to travel far to
play them. The fellows are about the same age
as we are, from eleven to fourteen.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What will be the name of the league?” asked
Skeets.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How does Monatook Lake League strike you?”
asked Frank. “Both towns are right on the lake,
just as Rockledge and Belden are.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Just the thing,” was the verdict of all.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Some of those town boys are dandy players,”
said Skeets. “I saw the Somerset team play once
and they certainly put up a fine game.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And the Ridgefield boys have a pitcher who is
a peach, all right,” said Frank. “But that’s just
what we’re looking for. It wouldn’t be any fun
defeating a lot of dubs.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll have to look out that they don’t ring in
some good players from other towns to fill up
weak places on their team,” said Fred.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course we’ll have to take a chance on that,”
admitted Frank. “But I don’t think we’ll have
to worry much. I know some of the boys on both
teams and they seem to be pretty square fellows.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’ll have to limber up that pitching arm of
yours and get it in good shape, Bobby,” cried Fred
jubilantly, clapping his friend on the shoulder.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How do you know I’ll get a chance to pitch?”
asked Bobby modestly. “The nine isn’t made up
yet and won’t be till we’ve had a chance to practice.
Some of the new fellows may be a good
deal better than I am at pitching.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t believe they will be,” returned Skeets.
“Do you remember, Fred, that last game when
Bobby pitched and we beat Belden by three to
two?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You bet I do,” replied Fred. “And I remember
that catch that Bobby made in the ninth inning
when he rolled over and over and yet held
on to the ball. If he had let it get away from him,
Belden would have won sure.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wish we could go right out on the field tomorrow!”
exclaimed impatient Fred, who was
very much worked up over the prospect of sport
that the new league opened up.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That would be rushing things for fair,”
laughed Frank.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It would hardly do to be playing ball in overcoats
and mittens,” grinned Skeets.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let’s see,” said Sparrow. “This is the
twenty-fifth of January. To the twenty-fifth of
February is one month and to the twenty-fifth of
March is another. The field ought to be in shape
for playing by that time. Don’t you think so,
Frank?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If we have a fairly early spring it ought to,”
said Frank. “Still in this climate I’ve seen snow
on the ground sometimes in April.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“February is a short month,” said Fred hopefully.
“That will cut the time down some.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Anyway we can do a whole lot of practicing
indoors,” said Bobby. “The gymnasium is good
and warm and we can rig up some kind of a cage
for pitching and catching.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Just as they do in colleges,” said Sparrow
proudly. “I tell you, fellows, we’re some class!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll bet the town papers’ll put in reports of the
games,” said Fred, who already in imagination
saw his name in print.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sure they will,” agreed Skeets. “They’ll be
glad of a chance to fill up space.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This was not very flattering, and Fred, who saw
fame coming his way with giant strides, rather resented
it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“They won’t do it only for that reason,” he said
indignantly. “I bet there’ll be some dandy games
played and lots of people in the towns will come
out to see them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Maybe, especially as they won’t have to pay to
get in,” retorted Skeets, who was not averse at
times to stirring Fred up just for the fun of seeing
him roiled.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, we can always count on big crowds when
Rockledge and Belden play anyway,” put in
Bobby, before Fred had a chance to throw back at
Skeets.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We ought to get some kind of monogram
sewed on our uniforms or caps to show the name
of the league,” said Sparrow, who was quite as
alive as Fred was to the new dignity that was coming
to them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The letters M. L. L. would look nifty, sure
enough,” agreed Bobby.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well there’s plenty of time to think of those
things before the season opens,” remarked Frank.
“The main thing now is to get up a team that will
put it all over the other fellows.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Just think how it would feel to be the champions
of the league,” said Sparrow.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And to pull up the pennant on the flagpole just
back of center field,” gloated Fred.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Rockledge wouldn’t be big enough to hold us,”
said Bobby.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s all right, fellows,” cautioned Frank.
“But remember all the other fellows are feeling
the same way. It’s easy enough to win games in
our dreams, but the only ones that count are those
that are won on the diamond.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll win them all right there too,” replied
Fred, who already saw himself cracking out a
home run with the bases full. “We’ll be there
with bells on from the time the season opens.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I bet we’ll go all through the season without
losing a game,” declared Sparrow, in a wild flight
of fancy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come off the perch,” warned Bobby.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Turn over, turn over, you’re on your back,”
said the irreverent Skeets.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’ll bring bad luck on us if you talk like
that,” cautioned Frank. “It stands to reason
that we’ll have to lose some games. The other
fellows are no slouches, don’t you forget that, and
they’ll be out to win just as we are.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The best teams in the big leagues lose lots of
games, even to the poorest ones,” said Bobby.
“You’ll notice that the nines that win the championships
don’t often come through the season
with much more than six hundred per cent.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Just what does that mean?” asked Skeets, who
had never been especially strong in mathematics.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bobby did a swift sum in mental arithmetic.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That means they won three games out of five,”
he announced. “So you see they had lots of losses
before they won the pennant. We’ve got a swell
chance of winning every game—I don’t think. If
we win six out of the nine, I shall be perfectly
satisfied. That will give us a percentage of six
hundred and sixty-seven.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bobby’s right,” confirmed Frank. “That
would be two out of every three, and the team that
wins isn’t likely to do any better than that. The
best team in the world will sometimes be whipped
by a poor one. That’s what makes baseball such
a bully game. Lots of good luck and hard luck
come into a game, and it’s never settled until the
last man is out in the ninth inning.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But in the long run it’s the best team that
wins,” protested Fred, still undaunted. “And
the best team in the Monatook Lake League this
year will be the team of Rockledge School.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXIV' class='c009'>CHAPTER XIV<br /> <br />GLOWING HOPES</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The boys all laughed at Fred’s declaration,
though they hoped ardently that it would turn out
to be true.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well,” conceded Frank, “confidence is a good
thing, especially if there is good hard work back
of it. One thing is certain, and that is if any team
beats Rockledge it will know it’s been in a fight.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I suppose Larry Cronk will be pitching for
Belden,” mused Fred.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I suppose so, and he’s a corking good pitcher
too. But Bobby beat him the last time he faced
him and I guess he can do it again.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Trust Bobby,” replied Fred loyally.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I’ll have to go now,” concluded Frank.
“I’m glad you boys think the league is going to
be a good thing.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The best thing that ever happened,” declared
Sparrow.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m tickled to death with it,” agreed Fred.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hits me awful hard,” said Bobby.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Monatook Lake League sounds mighty good to
me,” added Skeets.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There’s a lot of work to be done yet in getting
it fairly started,” observed Frank. “We’ll have
to work out a schedule of dates and decide on
the kind of pennant we’re going to have and a
bunch of things like that. But we’ll have plenty
of time for that, and everything will be running
slick as grease by the time the season begins.
And remember what I said, Fred, about cutting
out all hard feelings,” he concluded.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll do it all right,” answered Fred. “I don’t
like the fellow and I never will, but I’ll forget all
about that when it comes to working for the good
of the team.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s the way I like to hear you talk,” returned
Frank with a smile, as he went away.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What did Frank mean by that?” asked Skeets
curiously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, it’s about that Tom Hicksley,” Fred replied.
“Frank has heard that he’s a good ball
player, and if he is, he wants him on the nine. He
heard Bobby and me talking of the scrap we had
with him this morning, and he doesn’t want trouble
in the team.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Maybe Frank’s right, at that,” conceded
Skeets. “But I don’t know that it’s good dope to
have a fellow like that on the nine, no matter how
good a player he is. He’ll be wanting to run
things and perhaps break up the whole team.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll hope not,” said Bobby. “At any rate,
there’s no use worrying about it yet. He may
not be so good a player as Frank has heard he is,
and may not play on the team at all.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll have to look over our baseball togs and
see if they’re in good shape,” said Fred. “I know
the spikes on my shoes need sharpening.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And I’ll have to pound that new baseball
glove of mine until it’s good and soft and has a
big hollow in the middle,” added Bobby. “We
mustn’t overlook the least thing that’s going to
help us to win.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Won’t the Clinton boys open their eyes if we
can tell them when we go home for the summer
vacation that we’re the champions of the Monatook
Lake League?” gloated Fred.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t count your chickens before they’re
hatched,” laughed Sparrow. “It’s a long time
yet before the end of the season.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s all over but the shouting, the way I look
at it,” persisted Fred defiantly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t wake him up, he is dreaming,” mocked
Skeets.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The pennant bee is buzzing in his bonnet,”
laughed Sparrow.</p>

<p class='c008'>For that matter, they all heard the buzzing of
the same bee, and it was a very pleasant sound to
them. To these four eleven-year-old boys the
words “league” and “pennant” conveyed a sense
of dignity and importance that they had never
felt before.</p>

<p class='c008'>From that time on, baseball took up a large part
of their thoughts, even though the ground was
covered with snow and the lake held fast in icy
fetters.</p>

<p class='c008'>The gymnasium was warm and comfortable,
and though they had no regular cage and the limited
space did not give much chance for batting
practice the boys got in quite a lot of pitching and
catching. And this was quickened by the news
that came to them that Belden had taken up the
idea of the league with as much enthusiasm as
they had, and were already predicting that they
would be the victors in the coming struggle. It
was said that two of the new Belden boys were
hard hitters and could “send the ball a mile.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But we heard something like that before the
last game, and we licked them just the same,” remarked
Fred, who expected to play short stop,
the same position he had held the previous season.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Belden’s bark is worse than its bite,” confirmed
Bobby. “But because they didn’t come
through the last time doesn’t say they won’t now.
We’ll have to be right up on our toes all the time.
It isn’t going to be a walkover for anybody.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The study hours at Rockledge were not excessive,
and had been arranged with a view of giving
the growing boys all the time they needed for
wholesome exercise and recreation. Dr. Raymond
knew that a well trained mind and strong
body must go together in order to get the best results.
And on the occasions of the big baseball
and football games he was always sure to be present
as a keenly interested spectator.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Carrier, too, the second assistant on the
teaching staff, had himself been an athlete in his
college days, and his advice and coaching on the
diamond and the gridiron were very valuable to
the Rockledge boys.</p>

<p class='c008'>With the lake so near at hand, there were plenty
of winter sports. The smooth level of the ice,
stretching away for miles in every direction, made
skating a delight and offered a splendid field for
hockey games. On all fine afternoons and every
Saturday from morning till night, the ice was alive
with darting figures, and rang with the music of
steel against the frozen surface and the merry
laughter of the skaters as they cracked the whip or
flew by in impromptu races.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was plenty of snow on the ground this
year and this gave a chance for some good coasting.
Most of the boys had sleds, and Bobby had
brought along the splendid one that he had received
as a Christmas present.</p>

<p class='c008'>He had had considerable trouble in settling on
a name. Billy Barry’s suggestion that it be called
“Lightning” and Betty Martin’s laughing idea
that it ought to be called “Oyster,” because it
“slipped down so easily,” had received due consideration,
but Bobby had finally settled on “Red
Arrow.” This seemed to him to cover both its
color and its speed. And that speed could not be
questioned. It certainly shot down hill like an
arrow from a how. None of the other sleds at the
school could do such fetching.</p>

<p class='c008'>Naturally Bobby took great pride in his sled,
and the runners were rubbed with emery and oil
until they were as smooth as silk and shone like
silver.</p>

<p class='c008'>There were several good hills in the vicinity of
the school, but most of them were dangerous; one
because it crossed the railroad at its base and others
because cross streets, along which there was
much travel, offered chances for collisions. These
were therefore forbidden to the boys.</p>

<p class='c008'>On one hill, however, they were permitted to
coast whenever they wanted to do so. This
stretched away from the town, and there were no
cross streets throughout its entire length. It was
absolutely safe, and as it was very long and reasonably
steep, the boys felt no special regret at
not being allowed to use the other hills.</p>

<p class='c008'>For several days before Lincoln’s Birthday the
weather had been mild and there was a considerable
thaw. The snow on the hill had become soft
and mushy and coasting had been impossible.</p>

<p class='c008'>This interfered with the plans of the boys in
Bobby’s dormitory, who had expected to have a
big coasting carnival on the night of the holiday,
when there would be a full moon. Now it looked
as if the ground might be bare.</p>

<p class='c008'>But on the eleventh of February there came a
sudden change in the weather that gladdened the
hearts of the would-be coasters. The thermometer
fell rapidly until it was ten degrees below
zero. The hill froze solid and was even better
than it had been before, because the water from
the melting snow now formed a glare of ice over
the whole surface.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bobby and his chums were jubilant over the
change as they got together in the gymnasium
after breakfast on the morning of the holiday.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Isn’t it just bully?” cried Fred, doing a handspring.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The hill will be like glass,” gloated Mouser.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll bet we fetch further than we ever did
before,” exulted Bobby, who could see himself scudding
like the wind on his trusty Red Arrow.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But, gee! won’t it be tough climbing up to the
top again,” put in Pee Wee, who liked well enough
to ride down but hated the task of walking back.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t worry, Pee Wee,” chaffed Fred. “We
wouldn’t let a hard-working fellow like you walk
back. We’ll take turns drawing you up on our
sleds.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sure we will,” added Sparrow. “We’ll just
fight for the privilege.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’d hate to have Pee Wee bark his shins
again,” laughed Bobby.</p>

<p class='c008'>The boys were so engrossed in the lively give
and take that none of them noticed that Tom
Hicksley, who had been practicing on the rings
and had been near enough to hear their conversation,
had quietly slipped out of the gymnasium.</p>

<p class='c008'>There had been no open trouble between him
and Bobby and his friends since that morning
when the coming of Mr. Carrier had stopped the
quarrel. None of the boys took any special pains
to avoid him but had simply left him alone.
Hicksley had cast sullen and angry glances at
them as they passed him on the campus or in the
halls, but they cared nothing for that. They did
not doubt that he was nursing his grudge and
would lose no chance to get back at them if he
could, but they felt able to take care of themselves.</p>

<p class='c008'>As a matter of fact, Hicksley had only two
friends in the school. These were Bill Bronson
and Jack Jinks, the two most detested boys at
Rockledge. They were of the same type as Hicksley,
mean and tyrannical. They were two of the
largest pupils and took advantage of their size to
make themselves thoroughly disliked by the other
boys.</p>

<p class='c008'>They had “cottoned” to Hicksley at once, recognizing
him as a kindred spirit, and the three
were almost constantly together.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bronson and Jinks belonged to neither of the
dormitories, but occupied one of the smaller rooms
together.</p>

<p class='c008'>To this room Hicksley went straight from the
gymnasium and rapped on the door.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXV' class='c009'>CHAPTER XV<br /> <br />SPOILING THE FUN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>There was a scurrying within the room and
Hicksley heard the sound of a window being
hastily thrown up. Then after a long pause the
door was slowly opened.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, it’s you, is it?” said Bronson in a tone of
relief.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sure it is,” replied Hicksley tersely. “Who
did you think it was? What’s the matter with you
fellows anyway. Any one might think I was a
cop, from the time you took to open the door.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Worse than that,” grinned Bronson. “I
thought you might be Dr. Raymond or one of the
teachers. We were smoking. Now you’ve made
us throw away two perfectly good cigarettes and
freeze ourselves by opening the window to get the
smoke out of the room. Shut the window again,
Jack. It’s only Tom.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I’m not going to tell on you,” replied
Hicksley. “That is,” he added with a grin, “if
you’ve got another cigarette left for me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was strictly against the rules to smoke, but in
the opinion of these worthless fellows rules were
made only to be broken, and all three were soon
puffing away, after making sure that the door was
securely locked.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bronson was a tall, thin boy, with straw-colored
hair. Jinks was shorter, but very stocky. A
squint that made his small eyes look smaller still
gave him a most unprepossessing appearance.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, what’s up?” asked Bronson, seeing from
Hicksley’s manner that he had something to propose.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve just heard something that gave me an
idea of how to get even with that Bobby Blake
and the bunch of boobs he goes with,” replied
Hicksley.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hope it’s a good idea,” said Bronson. “Anything
that will down those fellows you can count
me in on.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Same here!” ejaculated Jinks. “I never had
any use for any of that crowd.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let’s have it, Tom,” broke in Bronson impatiently.
“Don’t keep us waiting.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“They’re planning to have a big coasting time
to-night,” explained Hicksley. “I heard them
talking about it when I was down in the gymnasium
just now. And while I was listening I
thought of a way to queer the whole thing.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This sounded promising, and the interest on the
faces of the others grew intense.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What is it?” they asked in the same breath,
leaning forward eagerly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hicksley lowered his voice a trifle and rapidly
outlined the plan that had come to him.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was fully satisfied with its reception, for
both of his hearers roared with delight.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s just bully!” cried Bronson.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Best thing I’ve heard since Hector was a
pup!” ejaculated Jinks.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’ll put a spoke in their wheel all right,”
gloated Hicksley.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Won’t they feel sore?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“They’ll be frothing at the mouth.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll have to be hiding somewhere near by
where we can see the whole thing,” said Bronson.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wouldn’t miss it for a hundred dollars,”
chuckled Jinks.</p>

<p class='c008'>“They’ll sing small for a long time after that,”
grinned Hicksley. “But now if you think the plan
is all right, we’ll have to figure out just how to go
about it. It’ll be a lot of hard work, and I don’t
want to do it myself. I don’t suppose you fellows
want to muss yourselves up either.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll tell you what!” exclaimed Bronson. “Do
you know who Dago Joe is?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’s that Italian fellow down town who goes
about doing odd jobs, isn’t he?” queried Hicksley.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s the one,” Bronson assented.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, what about him?” asked Hicksley.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Just this,” Bronson answered. “He’s just
the fellow for this job. He’s got a hand cart, and
that will make it easy for him. Then, too, a dollar
will look as big to him as a meeting house.
But even if he charges more than that we can all
chip in and it won’t make very much for any of
us.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wouldn’t care if it cost us a dollar apiece,”
said Jinks. “It would be worth it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They talked for a few minutes longer, and then
decided that rather than let Hicksley do it alone
they would all go down together to see Dago Joe.</p>

<p class='c008'>But to their surprise, Joe was at first inclined
to balk at the proposition. He was poor and had
a large family to support and he needed every
dollar he could get, but he seemed to fear that the
plan that the bullies suggested might get him into
trouble.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I donta know,” he said, shrugging his shoulders
and extending the palms of his hands. “Perhaps
people nota like it. Maybe I be arrest.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nonsense, Joe,” said Bronson. “There isn’t
a chance in the world that anybody will get on to
who did it. It will be after dark anyway. Be a
sport and take a chance.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll make it two dollars,” said Jinks. “It’s
easy money and you’d be a fool not to take it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Joe still had some qualms, but when the boys
raised the price to three dollars his scruples vanished.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You can get the stuff down near the roundhouse,”
suggested Jinks. “There’s always plenty
of it there.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Joe wanted his three dollars at once, but they
compromised by paying him half down with a
promise of the other half when the work was done.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now for the big blowout,” chuckled Jinks, as
they wended their way back to the school.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’ll be a scream,” gloated Bronson.</p>

<p class='c008'>“A perfect riot,” added Hicksley, who was in
high feather, now that his scheme seemed in a fair
way of going through.</p>

<p class='c008'>As for Dago Joe, he was a busy man for the
rest of the day and for some time after darkness
fell.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was an unusually good supper that night
in honor of the holiday, and the boys did it full
justice. But they would have lingered still longer
at the table, if they had not been impatient to get
out on the hill for their carnival of coasting.</p>

<p class='c008'>The wind had died down, but the air was keen
and brought a frosty glow to their eyes and cheeks
as they made their way to the hill, drawing their
sleds behind them by ropes that hung over their
shoulders.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll make a new record to-night,” said Bobby
jubilantly. “I shouldn’t wonder if we fetched as
far as the bridge; and we’ve never done that yet.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If we don’t do it to-night we never shall,” replied
Fred, as they came to the hill.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It doesn’t seem as if the sleds could ever stop
when they get started on ice like this,” exulted
Mouser.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll tell you what let’s do,” suggested Sparrow.
“The hill’s wide enough to hold six sleds
going down at the same time. There’s just about
seventeen or eighteen of us here. Let’s start out
in a bunch of six at a time and go the whole length.
Then, after that, we can have the separate races.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s all right,” agreed Fred. “The trouble
is that each fellow will want to go off in the first
six.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll soon settle that,” replied Sparrow.
“We’ll draw lots and then nobody will have any
kick coming.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This proposal was greeted with acclamation,
and amid a great deal of chaff and laughter the
lots were drawn.</p>

<p class='c008'>The lucky ones happened to be Fred, Bobby,
Mouser, Sparrow, Skeets and Pee Wee.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll let Pee Wee go in the middle,” laughed
Fred, “and we’d better take care to keep close to
the side of the road. He’ll need more room than
any of the rest of us.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’d hate to have him plunk into me,” grinned
Bobby. “It would be a case for the doctor, for
sure.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“For the undertaker, more likely,” chuckled
Mouser.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You fellows think you’re smart, don’t you?”
grunted Pee Wee. “All the same I bet I’ll fetch
farther than any of you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hear who’s talking,” jibed Sparrow. “We’ll
leave you so far behind you won’t be able to see
us with a telescope.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They ranged their sleds side by side and lay
upon them flat on their stomachs, holding firmly
on the sides in front in order steer correctly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Are you all ready?” asked Howell Purdy, who
had been chosen to give the word.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ready,” they answered.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then go!” shouted Howell.</p>

<p class='c008'>The six sleds shot forward with a rush.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXVI' class='c009'>CHAPTER XVI<br /> <br />WHO WAS GUILTY?</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>For the first third of the distance, the ice was as
smooth as quicksilver, with never a lump or hummock
to mar the surface. The sleds flew down
the frozen surface, gaining a velocity that took
the boys’ breath away and almost frightened them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then suddenly there was a jar, a chorus of
shouts, and they were thrown headlong over the
fronts of their sleds, landing in a confused heap
of limbs and bodies, while the sleds relieved of
their burdens swirled around aimlessly for a time
and finally came to a stop.</p>

<p class='c008'>A yell of consternation and alarm came from
the mass, as the boys tried to struggle to their
feet.</p>

<p class='c008'>Those who had been left at the top of the hill,
hearing the yells and knowing that some accident
had happened, came slipping and scrambling down
to the scene of the disaster.</p>

<p class='c008'>They helped the half stunned victims to their
feet, and for a time there was a wild hullabaloo of
questions and answers as they tried to solve the
mystery.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fortunately none of them was badly hurt, though
at the rate they were going it might very easily
have turned out to be a tragedy.</p>

<p class='c008'>Most of the boys had rubbed pieces of skin off
their arms and legs, and Fred had a cut in his
scalp from which the blood was flowing.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What did it?” shouted Howell.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know,” replied Bobby hesitatingly.
His head was going round like a top.</p>

<p class='c008'>“M-must have hit a tree trunk or something like
that,” stammered Sparrow.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That isn’t it,” replied Howell, looking around
him. “There isn’t anything of that kind in sight
as far as I can see. Just wait a minute till I get
Sam Thompson’s flashlight.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Luckily Sam had it with him and promptly
handed it over.</p>

<p class='c008'>Howell flashed it about him and gave a shout.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s ashes!” he cried. “The whole hill’s littered
with ’em.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ashes?” came a chorus of surprised questions.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s what it is,” declared Howell emphatically.
“There are heaps and heaps of ’em. I’ll
bet they reach clear down to the bottom of the
hill.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He went down further and confirmed what he
had said. He had no trouble in walking, for he
could not have slipped if he had wanted to. The
whole lower surface of the hill was strewn with
ashes that spoiled the coasting for that night utterly,
and promised to ruin it for many days to
come.</p>

<p class='c008'>A wave of wrath and fierce indignation swept
over the boys as they heard Howell’s report.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who could have done it?” was the question
that came to the lips of all.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Could it have been the town council?” suggested
Skeets. “They might have done it to keep
the horses from slipping.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“They never did anything like that before,” objected
Sparrow.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And if they were the ones, they would have
made a clean job of it and gone right up to the
top of the hill,” said Mouser. “But you fellows
will notice that it was perfectly clear for a long
part of the way down.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mouser is right,” declared Bobby. “Somebody
did this just to spoil our fun.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And they wanted us to be fooled and get
started down so that we’d get a tumble when we
came to the ashes,” added Fred. “That’s why
they left it smooth at the top.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Some of us might have been killed,” groaned
Skeets, gingerly soothing an injured knee.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And it’s only a bit of luck that we weren’t,”
growled Fred.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My shins are barked for fair,” moaned Pee
Wee, “and that’s no joke this time either.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Whoever did it was a low-down skunk,” burst
out Howell angrily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He might have been a murderer,” added
Skeets.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’d like to have my hands on him for a minute,”
declared Fred.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, our fun is over for this night anyway,”
said Bobby sadly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And for a whole lot of other nights,” put in
Pee Wee. “Those ashes will get ground in and
there’s no sweeping ’em off.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll have to wait for another snow storm
before we can do any more coasting,” wailed
Sparrow.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was a sorely disgruntled band of boys who
gathered up their sleds and limped slowly to the
top of the hill. One of the sleds was smashed and
all had been more or less scratched and bruised.</p>

<p class='c008'>Once at the top, they squatted down on their
sleds and held a council of war.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now, fellows,” said Bobby, “we’ve got to get
to the bottom of this thing somehow. The ashes
didn’t come there of themselves. Somebody put
them there, and whoever it was knew that we were
out for a grand coasting bee to-night. So it must
have been some fellow in the school.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hate to think that there’s any fellow at Rockledge
who could do such a dirty trick,” remarked
Howell. “If we can find out who it was we ought
to tell Doctor Raymond about it and have the fellow
sent away from school.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No,” objected Bobby. “This is our affair and
we oughtn’t to bring the teachers into it at all.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The question is who could have done it,” put
in Skeets.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Whoever did it is mean enough to steal sheep,”
growled Fred.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Or take the pennies from a dead man’s eyes,”
added Mouser.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can figure out just three fellows in the school
who could do a thing like that,” said Howell.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bill Bronson.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Jack Jinks.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Tom Hicksley.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The answers came from as many different lips,
and the readiness with which they were accepted
was not at all flattering to the boys who bore the
names.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It may have been one of those three or all
three together,” said Bobby, coming nearer to the
mark than he knew.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That reminds me,” cried Fred suddenly.
“Tom Hicksley was practicing on the flying rings
when we were talking this thing over in the gymnasium
this morning.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s so,” chimed in Mouser. “And I remember
now that he seemed to stop all of a sudden
and slip away. I didn’t think anything about it
then, but I remember it plainly now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He owes some of us a grudge for what
happened on the train,” remarked Pee Wee.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And he said then he’d get even with us,” observed
Fred.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There’s one thing we fellows have forgotten,”
said Skeets. “Whoever did this would want to
be hiding around and see what happened. We
ought to hunt them out and pay them up.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This seemed likely enough and the boys looked
eagerly about them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Doesn’t seem to be any place up here where
they could hide without our seeing them,” remarked
Mouser.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, but there’s a lot of bushes at the side of
the road half way down the hill,” put in Sparrow.
“Let’s go down there.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They went down in a body. There was no one
there, but as they got to the other side of the
bushes they could faintly make out three figures
retreating in the distance.</p>

<p class='c008'>They were too far away to be recognized and
they had too long a start to make it worth while
pursuing them, but from their general size and
build the boys had little doubt as to who they were.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What did I tell you?” cried Fred. “I knew
that they were the only ones who could do a thing
like that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It seems that the whole bunch of them are in
it,” remarked Mouser.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll bet that Hicksley went straight to them
and cooked this up when he left the gym this
morning,” conjectured Sparrow.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That makes something else we owe those fellows,”
growled Skeets.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We owed them enough without that,” said
Howell. “The big bullies have tried to pester the
life out of us ever since we’ve been at Rockledge.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Our turn will come,” replied Bobby with
conviction. “But now, fellows, we might as well
hustle back to the dormitory. There’s no use of
staying here any longer.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They made their way back to the school with
very different feelings from those they had when
they left it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“A holiday spoiled,” grumbled Mouser.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And there’s only two more holidays this
month,” observed Sparrow.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Two!” exclaimed Bobby. “There’s only one
more and that’s Washington’s Birthday.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How about St. Valentine’s Day?” objected
Sparrow. “That’s only two days from now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, that’s only a fake holiday,” replied Fred.
“Lessons will go on just the same.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t care whether it’s a fake holiday or a
real one,” answered Sparrow. “I’m going to get
a lot of fun out of it just the same.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXVII' class='c009'>CHAPTER XVII<br /> <br />ON THE TRAIL</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The school chums sat up late in the dormitory
that night, nursing their bruises, and by the time
they had got through applying arnica and other
lotions, the place smelled like a hospital.</p>

<p class='c008'>How they could bring the trick home to those
who had played it was a problem that was too
much for them at the present. They felt sure that
the bullies would deny it if taxed with it, and
there was no way of actually proving it, no matter
how sure they might feel in their own minds.</p>

<p class='c008'>The matter could of course have been carried
to the authorities of the school, and there is no
doubt that they would have looked upon it very
gravely because of the serious accident that might
have resulted from it. But their code of schoolboy
ethics was to keep the teachers out of such
things and fight it out among themselves. They
felt reasonably sure that sometime or other they
would get even, and they bided their time.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was a very lame and sore lot of boys who
dragged themselves out of bed when the rising hell
rang on the following morning.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Scubbity-<em>yow</em>!” exclaimed Fred. “I feel as
though I’d been in a railroad smash-up.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m one big ache all over,” groaned Pee Wee.</p>

<p class='c008'>“One <em>big</em> ache is right,” grinned Mouser.
“You couldn’t be a little one if you tried.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“My joints creak like a wooden doll’s, every
time I go to move,” complained Sparrow.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I bet I’ll go to pieces on the stairs and have to
be shoveled up in bits,” prophesied Skeets.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll each keep a part to remember you by,”
laughed Bobby. “Quit your groaning, you fellows,
and let’s go down to the table. You’ll feel
better when you get filled up.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The filling up process was carried out with neatness
and despatch, and when it was over the boys
were inclined to look on life in a more cheerful
way.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We can’t do anything this morning on account
of lessons,” remarked Bobby. “But as soon as
they’re over this afternoon, let’s make a break for
that hill and see what we can find out.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And see how Hicksley and his pals act in the
classrooms,” suggested Skeets. “That may give
us a tip to go by.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t count much on that,” said Mouser.
“They’ll be on their guard and won’t want to give
themselves away.”</p>

<p class='c008'>To a certain extent this proved true. There
was no attempt on the part of the bullies to gloat
over the victims of their trick. But the boys surprised
furtive grins and winks that passed between
the three when they thought no one was
looking, and this confirmed their suspicions that
now were almost certainties.</p>

<p class='c008'>“They did it all right,” pronounced Fred.
“I’m sure of it from the way I saw them grinning
at each other. But they’ll laugh on the other side
of their mouths before long.”</p>

<p class='c008'>As soon as the boys were free from their duties,
they went with all speed to the scene of their
misadventure. And again they lamented, when
they saw by daylight how thoroughly the hill was
spoiled for coasting.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There must be bushels and bushels of ashes!”
exclaimed Mouser, as his eyes roamed over the
lower half of the hill.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It beats me how they managed to get it all
here,” observed Skeets.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It must have been brought a long way,” commented
Sparrow. “There’s no place round here
they could have got them from.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“They couldn’t have carried all that stuff themselves,”
said Bobby thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It would have been an awful job,” added Howell,
“and those fellows don’t like work well enough
for that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“They might have hired a man with a horse
and wagon,” suggested Skeets.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If that’s so, there must be some tracks in the
snow,” returned Bobby. “Scatter out, fellows,
and see if you can find any marks of hoofs or
wheels.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They followed his directions, and in a moment
there was a cry from Sparrow.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Here’re the marks of wheels,” he called.
“But I don’t see any horse tracks.”</p>

<p class='c008'>There, indeed, were the clearly defined print of
wheels leading in a roundabout way toward the
town. As they looked a little more closely they
could see too where a man’s feet had broken at
places through the crust of snow.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It must have been a hand cart,” said Bobby,
“and you can see that it held ashes from the bits
that lie along its tracks. That’s what they
brought it in and you can bet on it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“There aren’t many hand carts in town,” observed
Fred reflectively. “How many do you fellows
remember seeing?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The laundryman has one,” replied Howell,
“and the paper man has another. Those are the
only ones I know of, except that shaky thing of
Dago Joe’s.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’s the fellow!” cried Fred excitedly.
“None of the others would lend their carts for
anything like that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let’s follow up the tracks and see where they
lead to,” suggested Sparrow.</p>

<p class='c008'>This was detective work to their liking and even
Pee Wee made no objections to the tramp over the
snow.</p>

<p class='c008'>Their satisfaction was increased when they
found that the tracks led straight to the roundhouse.
Here there were great piles of ashes that
had been dropped from the fire boxes of the locomotives
when they were being shifted or put up
for the night. It was quite clear that here was
the place where the hand cart had been filled.</p>

<p class='c008'>But their elation received a sudden check when
they prepared to trace the wheel prints to the
shabby shack in town where Joe lived with his numerous
brood. For now they were in the outskirts
of the town, where wagons were coming and
going all the time, and the tracks they had been
following were lost in a multitude of others.</p>

<p class='c008'>They looked at each other a little sheepishly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Stung!” muttered Fred.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bum detectives we are,” grinned Sparrow.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’re up a tree now for sure,” declared Sparrow.</p>

<p class='c008'>“All this walk for nothing,” growled Pee Wee.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We do seem to be stumped,” admitted Bobby.
“What do you say to going to Joe and asking him
right up and down whether he did it or not?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Swell chance we’d have of getting anything
out of him,” commented Mouser.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’d lie about it sure,” declared Sparrow.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I suppose likely he would,” agreed Bobby.
“But we might be able to tell something by the
way he acts. It won’t do any harm to try anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They found Dago Joe pottering about some
work in the small yard in front of his shack. But
Joe had seen them coming and his uneasy conscience
had taken alarm. If he had had time, he
would have slipped inside the house and had his
wife or one of the children deny that he was at
home. But it was too late for that, and he took
refuge in the assumed ignorance that had served
him many times before.</p>

<p class='c008'>He greeted them with a genial smile that
showed his mouthful of white teeth which was the
only personal attraction he possessed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Goota day,” he said blandly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How are you, Joe?” said Bobby, as spokesman
for the party. “Been pretty busy?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Joe’s mouth drooped.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not do nottin much,” he answered. “Beesness
bad, ver’ bad.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Carry any loads of ashes lately?” Bobby went
on.</p>

<p class='c008'>Joe looked puzzled. Then a light came into his
face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hash?” he said delightedly. “Me likea hash.
Tasta good. Bambino like it too.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not hash, but ashes,” returned Bobby, joining
in the laugh of the rest of the boys. “You know,
ashes—what falls out of the stove, wood ashes,
coal ashes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Joe’s face resembled that of a graven image.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No unnerstan,” he said, shrugging his shoulders
with an air of perplexity.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the face of his determination, the boys saw
that it was of no use to prolong the conversation.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re a good actor, Joe,” said Bobby, half
vexed, half amused, as the boys turned to go.</p>

<p class='c008'>Joe showed his teeth again in an engaging smile
that embraced all the party and waved them a cordial
good-bye.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How sweetly the old rascal smiles at us!”
grinned Mouser.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Laughs at us, you mean,” snorted Fred.
“He’s tickled to death inside to think of the way
he’s got the best of us.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I bet if we asked him if he’d like to have us
give him five dollars, he’d understand, all right,”
laughed Sparrow.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He couldn’t grab the money too quick,”
agreed Skeets.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, we haven’t wasted our afternoon anyway,”
Bobby summed up. “We’ve found out
how the ashes were taken there, and we feel dead
certain in our own minds that Joe did it. We
know, of course, that he didn’t do it of his own accord.
Somebody hired him to do it. Now if we
could only find some one who saw Hicksley and
Joe talking together, it would help some.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But that wouldn’t prove anything,” objected
Sparrow. “They might be talking about the
weather.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Or about hash,” interjected Pee Wee.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hash seems to stick in your crop,” grinned
Skeets.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wish some of it were sticking there right
now,” answered Pee Wee, “especially if it were
like the hash that Meena makes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“By the way, fellows,” chimed in Fred, “it
must be close to supper time this very minute.
Let’s beat it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They started off on a run.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The one that gets there last is a Chinaman,”
Skeets flung back over his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c008'>Pee Wee was the Chinaman.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXVIII' class='c009'>CHAPTER XVIII<br /> <br />A HARD HIT</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The next morning the boys woke to the realization
that it was St. Valentine’s Day. There were
valentines in their mail, valentines that had been
slipped slyly into their pockets, valentines that
had found their way under their pillows.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some of them were the grotesque “comics”
that were on sale in the village stationery store,
while others were mere scrawls adorned with so-called
pictures, and had been made by the boys
themselves with pen and pencil.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was not much art about them, but there
was a good deal of fun, and that was all the boys
were looking for. Most of them were based on
nicknames that the boys carried or on some event
in their lives that was known to the rest.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mouser, for instance, was pictured with his own
face on the body of a mouse who was creeping toward
a cage in which a big piece of cheese was
temptingly displayed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Skeets was buzzing about as a big mosquito,
over the bald head of a fat man, who was getting
ready to crash him as soon as he should settle
down.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fred’s red head had been drawn in red ink, and
above his flaming mop one boy was holding a frying
pan and another was breaking eggs to cook an
omelet.</p>

<p class='c008'>The boys had learned from Fred of the time
when Bobby had coasted down the Trent Street
hill and gone head over heels into the drift.
Bobby’s head could not be seen but his two heels
were waving wildly in the air and on one of them
was the word “Bobby” and on the other “Blake.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Of course Pee Wee had not been overlooked.
He was shown as a big fat boy, and each of his
knees had a dog’s head on it. The dogs were
barking furiously. This was supposed to indicate
his “barked” shins.</p>

<p class='c008'>Because Billy Bassett was always asking questions
with his conundrums, he was shown as a
great big question mark with the word “guess”
underneath.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sparrow Bangs sat on a branch with a flock of
birds, singing with all his might, while in the
bushes a hunter was taking careful aim and getting
ready to fire.</p>

<p class='c008'>Under most of the pictures there were verses
that brought forth shrieks of laughter—usually
from all, but sometimes from all but the recipient.</p>

<p class='c008'>As a rule, it was pure fun without any sting in
it, though Fred pointed out that the hair in the
picture was a good deal redder than that which
really waved over his freckled forehead. Pee Wee
too was sure that he was not anyway near so big
as the human mountain that his picture showed
him to be.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was plenty of chaff and laughter as the
boys pored over the valentines, and they would
have gladly spent more time discussing them.
But as Fred had said, Valentine’s Day was only
a “fake” holiday, and the hard-hearted teachers
insisted on lessons and recitations. So the pictures
were hastily thrust into pockets until they
had more time to look at them and the boys trooped
over to the classrooms.</p>

<p class='c008'>Several times through the morning’s work, they
noticed that Tom Hicksley shot furious glances at
them and this aroused their curiosity.</p>

<p class='c008'>“His royal highness seems mighty sore about
something this morning,” Fred whispered to
Bobby.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Got out of bed the wrong foot first maybe,”
replied Bobby.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hope he’s got something to feel sore about,”
snapped Fred.</p>

<p class='c008'>What that something was they learned after the
lessons were over, and they stood chattering with
their friends, a little way off from the main building.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hicksley came up to them, accompanied by Bronson
and Jinks. There was an ugly look in the
bully’s eyes and he held a folded sheet of paper
in his hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Which one of you boobs sent me this valentine?”
he asked threateningly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How do you know that any of us did?” replied
Bobby in Yankee fashion, answering a question by
asking one.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know that some of you did, because you
butted in on me before,” replied Hicksley.</p>

<p class='c008'>“When was that?” asked Fred aggravatingly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You know well enough,” growled Hicksley,
who was not any too anxious to recall his bully-ragging
of the old soldier.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, yes, I remember,” put in Mouser, as
though he had just thought of it. “You remember,
fellows, how Hicksley reached out his foot and
tried to trip the old man up.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I didn’t,” cried Hicksley untruthfully. “He
fell over it by accident.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And I suppose it was an accident that you kept
at him with the feather so that he couldn’t get any
sleep?” retorted Fred.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s neither here nor there,” snarled
Hicksley, dodging the matter. “What I want to know
is which one of you sent this valentine?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What are you going to do if you find out?”
asked Bobby innocently.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m going to give him a trimming that he’ll remember,”
growled Hicksley.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bronson and Jinks ranged up alongside of him
as though to assure him of their support, and it
looked as if trouble were coming.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Give it to him good and plenty, Tom,” said
Bronson.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The whole bunch of them need a licking,”
added Jinks.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It will take more than you to give it to us,”
blazed out Fred defiantly.</p>

<p class='c008'>The bullies were much larger and stronger than
any of the boys opposed to them. On the other
hand, the smaller boys had a larger number, so
that if a tussle did come, the forces would be about
equal.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What is this valentine you’re making all this
fuss about?” demanded Bobby.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Here it is,” cried Hicksley furiously, thrusting
it forward. “And I’m going to make the fellow
that sent it pay for it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The boys crowded round and looked at it curiously,
at the same time keeping wary eyes on the
bullies.</p>

<p class='c008'>The picture was fairly well done, and had evidently
taken a great deal of work and time on the
part of the one who had made it. It represented
a boy taking a dead mouse from a blind kitten.
The boy was grinning, and the kitten was pawing
wildly about, trying to get back its mouse.</p>

<p class='c008'>To make sure there could be no mistake, the
kitten had a card around its neck bearing the
words, “I am blind,” and under the figure of the
boy was scrawled the name, “Tom Hicksley.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The boys roared with laughter, and Hicksley’s
temper rose to the boiling point.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Own up now, which one of you did it,” he demanded
fiercely.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Whoever did it knew you pretty well, Tom
Hicksley,” said Fred.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What do you suppose the picture means?” inquired
Mouser, as though he could not quite make
it out.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think it means that the fellow who would take
a dead mouse from a blind kitten is about as mean
as they make them,” put in Sparrow.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mean enough to torment a poor old soldier, I
shouldn’t wonder,” added Shiner, pouring oil on
the flames.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Are you going to tell me who did it?” snarled
Hicksley once more, snatching back the valentine,
which he now regretted having shown, and doubling
up his fist.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I would have done it if I’d thought of it,”
Fred came back at him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hicksley sprang forward, followed by Bronson
and Jinks.</p>

<p class='c008'>The boys stood their ground and there was a
wild mix-up. In a moment they were all down in
the snow in a flying tangle of arms and legs.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was no telling how the tussle would have
terminated, though Hicksley was getting his face
well washed with snow that the boys were cramming
into his mouth and eyes, when a shout arose:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Cheese it, fellows, there’s a teacher coming!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The combatants scrambled to their feet and
scurried in all directions, and when Mr. Leith, the
head teacher, arrived on the spot, there was no one
to be seen.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bobby and his friends found themselves, red,
panting and uproariously happy, in their dormitory,
where they flung their books upon their beds
and fairly danced about with glee.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I jammed so much snow in Tom Hicksley’s
mouth that I bet he’ll taste it for a month,” chortled
Fred.</p>

<p class='c008'>“They tackled the wrong bunch that time,” gurgled
Mouser.</p>

<p class='c008'>“They thought we’d run,” chuckled Bobby.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wasn’t that a dandy valentine?” demanded
Skeets.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What a fool he was to show it,” grinned Pee
Wee. “Now it’ll go all over the school.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who do you suppose sent it?” wondered
Shiner.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’d give a dollar to know,” declared Fred.</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right,” grinned Sparrow, holding out his
hand. “Pass over the dollar.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You?” cried the other boys in chorus.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXIX' class='c009'>CHAPTER XIX<br /> <br />SPRING PRACTICE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“I’m the fellow who did it,” admitted Sparrow
modestly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sparrow, old scout, you’re a wonder!” cried
Mouser, clapping him on the back.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It hit him right where he lived,” chuckled
Skeets.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That pays him up for scattering ashes on the
hill,” grinned Fred.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’ll never hear the last of it as long as he
stays in school,” said Shiner. “Every once in a
while a dead mouse will turn up on his desk and
make him hopping mad.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’ll never be much madder than he was this
morning,” put in Skeets. “His eyes were fairly
snapping.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bronson and Jinks got theirs, too,” said Pee
Wee. “I guess they’ll think twice before they
pick on the other fellows again.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“They’ve been rather quiet since the goat tumbled
them over at our last initiation,” laughed
Bobby, referring to an incident of the previous
term, “but since Hicksley came they’ve been getting
ugly again. I guess what they got this morning
will hold them for a while.”</p>

<p class='c008'>As a matter of fact, the bullies did seem to be
somewhat dashed by the stout resistance that the
smaller boys had put up and they did not refer to
the valentine again. They were only too willing
to have it forgotten, and Tom Hicksley ground his
teeth more than once at not having kept it to himself.</p>

<p class='c008'>Spring was now at hand, coming this year a little
earlier than usual. The snow disappeared
from the ground, the ice vanished from the lake,
and the soft winds that blew up from the south
turned the thoughts of the boys to track games and
baseball.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fred and Bobby had done a good deal of practicing
in the gymnasium and were in prime condition.
But actual practice on the diamond was
the real thing they wanted, and they were delighted
when the ground had dried out enough to play in
the open air.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank Durrock had been busy for a month past,
getting all the details perfected for the entrance
of Rockledge into the Monatook Lake League.
But now everything was ready and he could devote
himself to picking the members of the team.</p>

<p class='c008'>This proved to be no easy matter. An
unusually large number of good players were at
Rockledge, and the struggle for places on the nine
was interesting and exciting.</p>

<p class='c008'>It seemed that Bobby should play in the pitcher’s
box and Fred at short stop. They had both
done exceedingly well at those positions the previous
spring and fall. But there was a new boy,
Willis by name, who had been a good short stop
on his home nine before he had come to the school,
and it seemed to be a toss up between him and
Fred as to who could do better in the position.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bobby, too, had rivalry to face in the person of
Tom Hicksley.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the first day that they actually had field practice,
Hicksley came out on the ball ground in an
old uniform that proclaimed that he had once been
a member of the “Eagles” of Cresskill, his native
town.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank knew that he had been a pitcher, and so
he put him in the box and had him toss up some
balls for the rest of the team in batting practice.</p>

<p class='c008'>And Hicksley did exceedingly well. Whatever
his defects in character, he certainly knew how to
pitch. He had a good outcurve, a fair incurve
and a high fast ball that Bobby himself generously
declared to be a “peach.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Hicksley’s height and strength, too, were greater
than Bobby’s, which was not to be wondered at
when it was considered that he was three years
older. But he was inclined to be a little wild, and
his control was not as good as Bobby’s.</p>

<p class='c008'>But what made his work of special interest to
Frank was that he pitched with his left hand.
Most of the pitchers in the new league were right-handed,
and the boys were used to hitting that kind
of pitching.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank felt that with a left-handed pitcher he
would have the other fellows all at sea when it
came to “lining them out,” and for that reason
he watched Hicksley with the closest attention.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He puts them over all right,” conceded Bobby,
as he watched Hicksley winging them over the
plate.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” said Fred, “when he gets them over at
all. But lots of them don’t even cut the corners.
He’ll give too many bases on balls.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And a base on balls is as good for the fellow
that gets it as a base hit,” commented Mouser.</p>

<p class='c008'>“His arm seems to be all right, but we don’t
know how he’ll act when he gets in a pinch,” said
Skeets dubiously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s what makes Bobby so strong as a
pitcher,” said Shiner. “No matter how tight a
hole he finds himself in, he’s cool as an iceberg.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s so,” remarked Pee Wee, who was too
fat and too slow to play himself, but was an ardent
rooter for the home team. “I’ve never seen
Bobby get rattled yet.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s because there isn’t a bit of yellow in
him,” said Fred, throwing his arm affectionately
about his chum’s shoulder.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And I’ll bet that Hicksley has a yellow streak
in him a yard wide,” snapped Sparrow.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh he may not be that way when it comes to
baseball,” remonstrated Bobby who always tried
to be fair. “At any rate he ought to have a chance
to show what he can do before we make up our
minds about him. You fellows know that I don’t
like him a bit more than you do, but that doesn’t
say he may not be a good baseball player.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Jinks was not on the nine, but Bronson, who was
a good batter and a fair fielder, was expected to
play center field. They were both delighted at
the showing that their crony was making and were
loud in their applause. Their praise was so extravagant
in fact that it was clear that they did it
to depreciate Bobby.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re the best pitcher we ever had at Rockledge,
Tom,” cried Bronson, casting a side glance
at Bobby to make sure that he heard.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You lay over them all,” crowed Jinks.
“There’s no one else can hold a candle to you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Here, cut that out, you fellows,” called Frank
Durrock sharply. “Blake has proved what he can
do and I don’t want any talk like that. He won
both of the last games he pitched against Belden,
and any one who can do better than he did will
have to be going some.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You bet they will,” cried Fred loyally, and
there was a round of hand clapping from the other
boys, with most of whom Bobby was a prime favorite.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank’s hearty defense put Bobby on his mettle,
and when his turn came to put the balls over, he
did so with a snap and skill that delighted his
friends.</p>

<p class='c008'>The practice all around was sharp and spirited,
and Frank was greatly encouraged as he saw how
well the team took hold. But it would not do to
play too long on the first day, and after an hour or
so, he called a halt.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We want to keep an eye on those fellows,
Bobby,” remarked Fred a little uneasily as they
were going toward the school. “They’re going
to crowd you out if they can.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let them try,” replied Bobby. “I’m going to
try my best to hold up my end with Hicksley and
beat him if I can. But if he can prove that he’s a
better pitcher than I am, I won’t kick if I have to
play second fiddle. I’d be willing to do anything
to help Rockledge win.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXX' class='c009'>CHAPTER XX<br /> <br />THE SUGAR CAMP</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>An untimely snow storm that was wholly unlooked
for by the boys dismayed them by putting a
stop to their practice for the time being. But the
snow, though heavy, did not last long, and began to
melt rapidly under the rays of the sun.</p>

<p class='c008'>“See how the water is running down those
trees,” remarked Shiner, looking out of the window
one Friday morning.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That isn’t water, boy,” said Sparrow.
“That’s sap. The trees are bursting with it just
now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“By the way, fellows,” put in Skeets, “have
you ever been to a maple sugar camp when the sap
was running?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Most of them had not and Skeets went on to
explain.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s the best fun ever,” he said; “and now’s
just the time to see it running full blast when the
snow is melting and the air is warm. On a day
like this the sap comes down in bucketfuls. And
you can see just how they collect it, and how they
boil it down until it’s a thick syrup, and the way
that hot maple sugar does taste—yum yum!” and
here he closed his eyes in blissful recollection.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sounds mighty good to me,” said Pee Wee,
with whom the memory of Meena and her breakfast
of buckwheat cakes and maple syrup still
lingered.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You can take out the hot sugar in big spoons
and let it cool on a pan of snow,” continued Skeets,
drawing out the details as he saw that his friends’
mouths were watering in anticipation, “and when
you get the first taste of it you never want to stop
eating.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wonder if there’s a sugar camp anywhere
around here,” said Pee Wee with great animation.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know of one that’s about three miles away,”
said Sparrow. “What do you say to our making
up a party and going out there to-morrow if Doc
Raymond will let us go out of bounds?”</p>

<p class='c008'>There was a general chorus of gleeful assent.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What we ought to do,” said Skeets, “is to have
a couple of fellows go out there to-day and make
arrangements. We want to take up a collection
and fix it up with the farmer’s wife to have hot
biscuits and other things ready for us. I tell you
what, fellows, hot biscuits and fresh butter and
hot thick maple sugar just out of the boiler—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t say another word,” cried Pee Wee
frantically, “or I’ll never, never be able to wait till
to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They took stock of their resources and collected
several dollars between them, enough they thought
to cover the expense. Bobby and Fred were appointed
as a committee of two to go out to the
camp that afternoon so that everything would be
in readiness on the morrow.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Raymond’s permission was readily obtained,
and the chums set out on their three mile
walk. They had no trouble in finding the camp
and the farmer’s wife, a bright, cheery person,
was very ready to entertain the party and promised
to have an abundant lunch provided for them.</p>

<p class='c008'>The boys would have dearly liked to inspect the
camp, but they had promised their chums that
they would not do so until all could see it together,
and they kept loyally to their word.</p>

<p class='c008'>No finer day could have been selected for that
particular outing than the one that dawned the
next morning. The air was mild and the sun shining
brightly. The only drawback was the walking,
as the roads were full of mud in some places and
melting slush in others, but as they were all
warmly shod that made little difference.</p>

<p class='c008'>Pee Wee groaned occasionally as he lagged
along in the rear, but they had no fear of his dropping
out. It would have taken a good deal more
than a three-mile walk to keep Pee Wee away from
that sugar camp after Skeets’s description.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There it is,” cried Fred at last, pointing to a
big grove of trees in the rear of a farmhouse.</p>

<p class='c008'>Pee Wee sniffed the air.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Seems to me I can smell the sugar cooking
from here,” he said joyously.</p>

<p class='c008'>They left the road now, took a short cut across
the fields and soon entered the grove of maples.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was an extensive grove, containing several
hundred of the stately trees. Into each one of
these that had reached their full growth a hole
had been made, a spigot driven in, and a bright
tin pail suspended from each spigot. Into these
pails the sap was falling with a musical drip so
that a tinkling murmur ran through the grove
as though some one were gently touching the
strings of a zither.</p>

<p class='c008'>An old horse attached to a low sled was shambling
slowly along through the woodland paths,
stopping at each tree. The driver would empty
the pail into one of several large cans that the
sled contained, replace the pail and go on to the
next.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Seems almost a shame to tap those splendid
trees,” murmured Mouser. “It’s almost like
bleeding them to death.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Doesn’t do them a bit of harm,” explained
Skeets cheerfully. “The farmers take good care
not to drain out more sap than the tree can spare.”</p>

<p class='c008'>When the sled had made its round, the boys followed
it to the shed where the sap was boiled
down into sugar. Here they saw an enormous
caldron with a roaring fire underneath. Into this
caldron the sap was poured, and here its transformation
began. A delicious odor arose that made
the nostrils of the boys dilate hungrily.</p>

<p class='c008'>Every little while, the man who was supervising
the boiling drew out a huge ladleful to see how
thick it was getting. At a certain stage he turned
to the boys with a grin.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Each one of you take one of those pans,” he
directed, pointing to a bright row of dairy tins
which the housewife had made ready. “Fill them
up with snow and pack the snow down hard.”</p>

<p class='c008'>In a twinkling the boys were ready. Then, as
each held up his pan, the man poured a big ladle of
the hot syrup on the snow. The rich golden brown
against the whiteness of the snow would have delighted
the soul of an artist. But these lads were
not artists, only hungry boys, and their only concern
was to get the sugar cool enough to eat.</p>

<p class='c008'>Pee Wee in fact burned his lips and tongue by
starting too soon, but he soon forgot a trifle like
that, and in a moment more he and the others were
eating as if they had never tasted anything so
good in all their lives.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hot biscuits coming, boys,” smiled the farmer.
“Better leave some room.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let them come,” mumbled Mouser with his
mouth full of sugar. “None of them will go away
again.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And they made good this prophecy when a little
later they were called into the farmhouse, where a
table was spread, heaped high with fluffy biscuits
just from the oven. On these the boys spread butter
and then piled them up with the delicious
syrup. There were other things on the table too,
pickles and pies and cakes, but to these the boys
paid slight attention. They could have those any
day, but to-day maple sugar was king.</p>

<p class='c008'>When at length they were through, they all
acknowledged to having eaten more than was good
for them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll have to use a derrick to get Pee Wee on
his feet,” laughed Bobby.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And borrow the horse and sled to take him
back to school,” said Sparrow.</p>

<p class='c008'>But it was not quite so bad as that, though after
they started back the other boys had to moderate
their gait in order not to leave Pee Wee too far
behind.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hurry up, Pee Wee,” admonished Skeets.
“You’re slow as molasses.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Slow as maple syrup when it’s cooling,”
amended Sparrow.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, fellows, this has sure been a bully trip,”
remarked Shiner, summing up the sentiments of
all.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This is the end of a perfect day,” Fred chanted
gayly, lifting up his voice in song.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXI' class='c009'>CHAPTER XXI<br /> <br />THE FIRST GAME</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Notwithstanding Fred’s jubilant song, the day
was not yet ended.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the boys approached the school, they saw a
figure in the road a little way ahead that seemed
familiar to them. They quickened their pace,
quickly overtaking Dago Joe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hello, Joe,” came from many voices at once.</p>

<p class='c008'>Joe flashed them a smile, showing his fine, white
teeth.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hello,” he answered genially.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wonder if he’s as fond of hash as ever,” Fred
remarked in a low voice to Mouser.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What are you doing up this way, Joe?” asked
Bobby.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Looking for any one?” inquired Sparrow.</p>

<p class='c008'>But Joe was wary and refused to be drawn out.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Can’t get that old fox to give himself away,”
muttered Skeets.</p>

<p class='c008'>Just then Tom Hicksley approached, accompanied
by Bronson and Jinks. They caught sight
of Joe at the same time that he saw them, and
tried to retreat. Bronson and Jinks succeeded,
but Joe was too quick for Hicksley, and hurrying
forward laid his hand on his arm, while he jabbered
away excitedly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ha ha!” exclaimed Fred in a tragic way. “I
see it all now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’s boning Hicksley for something,” guessed
Sparrow.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Money, I’ll bet,” ventured Shiner.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I shouldn’t wonder if it’s on account of that
job he did for those fellows, hauling those ashes,”
said Bobby.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wasn’t it luck that we happened along just at
this minute?” chuckled Mouser delightedly.</p>

<p class='c008'>As Joe and Hicksley were right in the path that
led up to the school, the boys sauntered along carelessly
until they were nearly abreast of them.</p>

<p class='c008'>For a man who understood so little English, Joe
was talking at a great rate.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wanta ze mon,” the boys heard him say.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I tell you I haven’t got it with me just now,”
Hicksley responded in an undertone, trying to
quiet the man and keep the boys from hearing.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wanta ze mon now,” repeated Joe doggedly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, give the man his money, Hicksley,” broke
in Sparrow suddenly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He needs it to buy hash with,” said the irrepressible
Fred.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let’s take up a collection to help out,” suggested
Skeets sarcastically.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You fellows shut up,” cried Hicksley, turning
on them fiercely.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We know how he earned it,” returned Bobby
undauntedly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You don’t know anything of the kind,” snarled
the bully, but his eyes wavered as they met
Bobby’s fixed upon them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It was pretty hard work carting ashes all that
way to spoil our coast,” went on Bobby. “You’d
better pony up, Hicksley.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know what you’re talking about,”
growled Hicksley.</p>

<p class='c008'>But as he did not like the way the boys were
gathering around him, he put his hand in his
pocket, drew out the dollar and a half that he had
promised to pay when the work should be finished
and which he had ever since been trying to cheat
Joe out of, and slunk away, glad to escape the contempt
that he felt in the eyes and manner of the
boys.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Caught with the goods!” cried Fred jubilantly,
throwing his cap into the air.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Couldn’t have been nicer if we’d planned it
ourselves,” exulted Sparrow.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, now that we’re sure that he did it, what
are we going to do about it?” asked Skeets.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I guess there’s nothing to be done,” said
Bobby slowly. “If it wasn’t that he’s likely to be
on the baseball team we might make it hot for him.
Not with the teachers of course, but among ourselves.
But we want Rockledge to win the championship,
and it won’t help any to have trouble
with any boy on the nine. Besides, he’s had a
good deal of punishment just in the last few minutes.
I never saw a fellow look as cheap as he did
when he faded away just now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I guess you’re right, Bobby,” assented Sparrow.
“But all the same he wouldn’t let up on you
if he had you in a fix.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The next day they all felt rather logy after their
feast of the day before, and Pee Wee, who had a
severe stomach ache, did not get up at all. Fortunately
it was Sunday, and the day of rest helped
to get them in shape again before their school
duties began on Monday morning.</p>

<p class='c008'>From that time on the weather was all that the
boys could ask, and every hour the ball players
could spare was spent in practice on the diamond.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gradually, under the coaching of Mr. Carrier,
their athletic instructor, ably assisted by Frank
Durrock, the nine was getting into good form.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fred, at short stop, was thought to be a shade
better than Willis, and he was slated to play in the
first game.</p>

<p class='c008'>As to the pitchers, while there was no doubt that
they would be Bobby and Hicksley, it was by no
means certain which of them would twirl in the
opening game, which was to be with the Somerset
nine on the Rockledge grounds.</p>

<p class='c008'>Each was doing well, and each had some points
that the other did not possess. Hicksley, the older
of the two, had more muscular strength, and could
whip the ball over with more speed than Bobby.
But Bobby was a better general, a quicker thinker,
and he had a control of his curves that was far
better than his rival’s.</p>

<p class='c008'>“One thing is certain,” said Mr. Carrier, in one
of his conferences with Frank. “We’re better
fixed in the box than we ever were before. It’s
hard to choose between them, though, take all
things together, I think Blake is the better pitcher
of the two.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” agreed Frank. “I feel a little safer myself
with Bobby in there than I do with Hicksley.
Hicksley has lots of speed but he’s liable to go up
with a bang. But I’ve never yet seen Bobby get
rattled.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The long expected day arrived at last, and all
Rockledge turned out to see the game. The stand
was full, and Dr. Raymond himself, with most of
the teachers, sat in a little space that had been
railed off and decorated with the Rockledge colors.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Somerset nine, made up of strong, sturdy
looking boys, had come over with a large number
of rooters from their town. They were full of
confidence, and they went through their preliminary
practice with a snap and a vim that showed
they were good players.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank had watched them as they batted out flies,
and noted that several of them were left-handed
batters. He held an anxious conference with Mr.
Carrier, and then came over to Bobby who was
warming up.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I had expected to have you pitch to-day,
Bobby,” he said; “but I’ve just been noticing that
those fellows have two or three left-handed batters.
Now you know as well as I do that for that
kind it’s best to have left-handed pitching. They
can’t hit it so easily.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sure,” replied Bobby.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And so I think I’ll have to put in Hicksley,”
continued Frank.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s all right,” said Bobby heartily, “and
I’ll be rooting my head off for him to win.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re a brick, Bobby!” exclaimed Frank. “I
was sure you’d understand.”</p>

<p class='c008'>When the umpire cried: “Play ball!” there was
a buzz of surprise among the spectators, when, instead
of Bobby, it was Tom Hicksley who picked
up the ball and faced the batter.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXII' class='c009'>CHAPTER XXII<br /> <br />TO THE RESCUE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Hicksley started off in good shape. The first
man up went out on a foul that Sparrow caught
after a long run. The second batter, who was left-handed,
could do nothing with the ball at all and
went out on strikes. The third man connected and
shot a sharp grounder which Fred picked up neatly
and threw in plenty of time to Durrock at first.</p>

<p class='c008'>The side was out, and hearty applause greeted
Hicksley as he came in to the bench, Bobby joining
in as heartily as any of the others.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That was a dandy start!” cried Bronson.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Keep it up, Tom!” exclaimed Jinks, encouragingly.
“They can’t touch you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Rockledge was more fortunate in its half of the
inning. Frank, who led off in the batting order,
had two halls and one strike called on him, but on
his second attempt he sent the ball on a line between
center and right for three bases. He was
tempted to try to stretch it to a home run, but
Bobby, who was coaching, saw that the ball would
get there before him and held him at third.</p>

<p class='c008'>The next batter fouled out, but Mouser, who followed
him, sent a neat single to left on which Frank
scored easily. Barry went out on strikes, and
Mouser was left on the bag when Spentz died on a
weak dribbler to the box.</p>

<p class='c008'>But Rockledge was one run to the good and had
shown that they were in a batting humor, so that
their rooters in the stand were jubilant at the
promising beginning.</p>

<p class='c008'>The next two innings went by without a score for
either side. Hicksley was still pitching well, and
the opposing pitcher had tightened up considerably.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the fourth, Somerset broke the ice. The first
man up laid down a bunt that Hicksley picked up,
but threw wild to Durrock, and the batter reached
second before the ball was recovered. A neat sacrifice
put him on third, from which he scored on a
long fly to right, which Spentz gobbled after a
long run, but could not return to the plate in time
to catch the man running in from third after the
out. No further damage was done as Fred and
Durrock disposed of the batter, but the score was
tied, and it was Somerset’s turn to cheer.</p>

<p class='c008'>But Rockledge got the run right back again in
the fifth, and added one for good measure. Fred
smashing out a rattling two-bagger to left. He
stole third on the first ball pitched. Two infield
flies followed, and it began to look as though
Fred’s hit had gone for nothing. Then Mouser
brought the stand yelling to its feet by a clean
home run, following Fred over the plate and making
the score three to one.</p>

<p class='c008'>His comrades gathered around him, pawing and
mauling him exultantly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s what you call hitting it a mile!” cried
Bobby.</p>

<p class='c008'>“A lallapaloozer!” shouted Fred, doing a war
dance.</p>

<p class='c008'>“A peach!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A pippin!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re all there, Mouser!” yelled Pee Wee.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mouser grinned appreciatively at the medley of
shouts that greeted him, and then retired to the
bench, where he sat panting and happy.</p>

<p class='c008'>Radford, the Somerset pitcher, pulled himself
together and retired the next man on strikes, and
Somerset came in for its turn at the bat.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Go for ’em now, fellows!” shouted their supporters.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Eat ’em up!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Get right after ’em!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The game’s young yet.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But Hicksley, encouraged by the two-run lead
his team had handed him, was still more than they
could solve, and again they went out into the
field runless.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Rockledge boys also had a goose egg for
their portion in their half, but this did not worry
them much. The game was two thirds over, and
at that stage a lead of two runs looked mighty good
to them.</p>

<p class='c008'>But in the seventh inning their confidence began
to give way to anxiety. Hicksley began well by
retiring the first man on strikes. But then he
began to lose control. Two batters in succession
were given their bases on balls. A fine pickup of
Fred’s disposed of the next batter at first, each of
the others advancing a base on the play. There
was only one other to be put out and end the inning
without a run being recorded.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the next batter landed square on the ball,
which whizzed like a bullet between first and second,
and in a jiffy two runs came over the plate,
tying the score. The batter reached second on the
play and then imprudently tried to make third. A
quick throw to Sparrow caught him ten feet from
the bag and the side was out.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hicksley came in shaking and with a strained
look in his face. The Rockledge rooters yelled encouragement
to him, but he paid no attention to
them and sat moping sullenly on the bench.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frank and Mr. Carrier had a hurried consultation,
and then the former came over to Bobby.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’d better get out there at one side and
warm up,” he directed him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bobby did as ordered.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What are you going to do?” demanded Hicksley
in a surly tone. “Take me out and put that
fellow in?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not yet,” answered Frank soothingly.
“You’ve had a bad inning, but that can happen
to any one. Perhaps you’ll be all right after
a rest. We’ll see how you start out the next inning.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Somerset boys, with their chances brightened,
had taken a mighty brace, and Rockledge
went out in one, two, three order.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hicksley took up his position in the box with an
air of confidence that Frank felt was assumed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Still, the first ball he pitched cut the plate for a
strike. The next two were balls. Then followed
another strike and a third ball, making the count
three and two.</p>

<p class='c008'>With both batter and pitcher “in the hole,” the
next was a hall and the batter capered happily
down to first.</p>

<p class='c008'>Durrock walked over to Hicksley.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How about it, Hicksley?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let me alone,” growled Hicksley.</p>

<p class='c008'>The next batter connected for a clean single, advancing
his mate to second.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hicksley now was plainly cracking, and when
he issued another “pass,” filling the bases, Frank
motioned him to retire and beckoned Bobby to the
box.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hicksley glared at Bobby as the latter came forward.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sorry, Hicksley,” said Bobby regretfully, as
he reached out for the ball. “You pitched a dandy
game for the first six innings.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, you’re sorry a lot,” snarled Hicksley.
“You’re tickled to death at the chance to show me
up.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Instead of handing the ball to Bobby, he threw
it angrily on the ground and slouched away to the
bench.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bobby’s eyes flashed, but he controlled himself,
quietly picked up the ball and took his position in
the box. It was no time now to get angry when he
needed above all things to keep cool.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was a trying position for so young a player.
The bases were full with no one out, and the
Somerset rooters were yelling at the top of their
lungs, trying to rattle him.</p>

<p class='c008'>A clean hit would bring in at least one run, probably
two. Even a long fly to the outfield would
probably enable the man on third to score.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Go to it, Bobby, old boy!” called Fred from
short.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You can hold them!” encouraged Mouser.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’re all behind you, Bobby!” sang out Sparrow.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bobby sized up the batter and wound up for the
first pitch.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXIII' class='c009'>CHAPTER XXIII<br /> <br />THE EGG AND THE FAN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The ball whizzed over the plate, cutting an outside
corner for a strike.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Rockledge rooters regarded this as a good
omen and greeted it with wild shouts. They all
had a warm spot in their hearts for Bobby, and
they had been disgusted at the unsportsmanlike
way in which Hicksley had left the box.</p>

<p class='c008'>The next ball was a high fast one, at which the
batter refused to bite.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bobby had seen out of the corner of his eye that
the occupant of the third bag was taking too big
a lead. As the ball came back to him from the
catcher, he suddenly turned and shot it to third.</p>

<p class='c008'>The runner tried frantically to get back, but
Sparrow had the ball on him like a flash.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re out!” shouted the umpire.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Scubbity-<em>yow</em>!” yelled Fred. “That was nice
work, Bobby.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This relieved the pressure somewhat, and the
crowd breathed more freely.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the danger was still threatening, and the
batter was the captain of the Somerset team and
one of its best hitters. He fouled off the next two.
On his third attempt, he chopped a bounder to
Mouser at second, who made a clever stop and
threw him out at first, while the runners each advanced
a base.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Two down,” cried Sparrow from third.
“You’re getting them, Bobby. Keep it up.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Bobby now put on all steam. There was only
one more inning after this one, and he did not
need to save his arm. He sent two outcurves in
succession. Each went for a strike. Then when
the batter was set for another of the same kind,
Bobby outguessed him with a straight fast one,
and the ball plunked into the catcher’s mitt for an
out.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was a chorus of cheers from the Rockledge
rooters as Bobby drew off his glove and
came in to the bench.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s what you call getting out of a hole,”
cried one.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The bases full and nobody out and yet they
couldn’t score,” shouted another.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll give you a run this time, Bobby, and all
you’ll need to do then will be to hold them down in
the ninth,” prophesied Frank, as he selected his
bat.</p>

<p class='c008'>He started in to make his words good by
cracking out a single on the second ball pitched. A sacrifice
bunt to the right of the pitcher’s box advanced
him to second. The next batter went out
on an infield fly that held Frank anchored to the
bag. Barry was given his base on balls. Then
Spentz walloped a corker to left, on which Frank
scored and Barry reached third. A moment later
a quick throw caught him napping and the side was
out.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’re in the lead now, Bobby,” exulted Fred,
as Rockledge took the field. “Put the kibosh on
them just once more and we’re all right.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Make this inning short and sweet, old scout!”
sang out Mouser.</p>

<p class='c008'>And short and sweet was what Bobby made it.
He was on his mettle, and put every bit of control
he had upon the ball. Despite the frantic efforts
of the Somerset coachers to rattle him, he kept perfectly
cool. Victory was too close now for him
to let it go.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first batter up knocked a high foul to Sparrow,
who held it tight. The next sent a weak
bounder to Frank, which he tossed to Bobby, who
had run over to cover the bag. Then Bobby shattered
the last hope of Somerset by striking out the
last man on three pitched balls.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Rockledge rooters, wild with delight,
rushed down from the stands and gathered about
their favorites, who were grinning happily. They
had played a good game and deserved to win, but
Bobby, because of his gallant stand when the team
had its back against the wall, came in naturally
for the lion’s share of the applause.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That was some sweet pitching all right.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You had them standing on their heads.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Your nerve was right with you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wait till he tackles Belden. He’ll show them
a thing or two.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m glad we pulled through all right,” said
Bobby modestly. “All the boys put up a dandy
game. And don’t forget that Hicksley held them
down splendidly in the first part of the game.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s so,” conceded Mouser. “But when it
came to the pinch he cracked.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He couldn’t stand the gaff,” put in Sparrow.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Any pitcher will get knocked out of the box
sometimes,” argued Bobby. “Then, too, he had
been pitching six hard innings and was tired. I
was fresh when I went in and only had two innings
to pitch.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Hicksley had left the bench as soon as the last
man was out. He could not bear to wait to see the
praise that he knew would be showered on his
rival. He had been joined by Jinks and Bronson,
and the three were now slouching grumpily toward
the school buildings.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Doesn’t seem as if they were tickled to death
because Rockledge won,” commented Fred, as he
looked at the group.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, the rest of us are, anyway,” cried Sparrow.
“We’ve made a mighty good start, taking
the first game.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can see the pennant flying from that pole
already,” jubilated Skeets, pointing to the flagstaff
back of center field.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’ve got dandy eyesight, Skeets,” laughed
Bobby. “We’ve got a long way to go yet.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“One swallow doesn’t make a summer,” cautioned
Frank, who, while he was as pleased as the
rest, did not want his team to be too confident.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And if the Ridgefield nine is as good as the
Somersets, we’ll have our work cut out for us,”
remarked Mouser. “Those fellows gave us all we
wanted to do to win.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“They put up a bully fight,” agreed Shiner.</p>

<p class='c008'>Doctor Raymond came down among the boys to
congratulate them on the victory they had won for
the school, and Mr. Carrier was even more enthusiastic
over the success of his charges.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’ve made a fine start, boys, and I’m proud
of you,” he told them. “Now, don’t let down a
bit, but keep it right up to the finish of the season.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We will.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Trust us.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ve only begun to fight.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s the right spirit,” said Mr. Carrier,
smiling. “And now to make you feel better, I’m
going to tell you that I’ve just received a telegram
that Ridgefield whipped Belden this afternoon
by seven to three.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A tremendous shout arose at this. They had
counted on Belden as the rival from whom they
had the most to fear, and they were immensely
pleased to learn that it had begun the season with
a defeat.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was a jubilant throng of boys that made their
way toward the school buildings that afternoon.
They knew that a rocky road lay ahead of them,
but a good deal depended upon the start, and it
was a great thing to know that they had the lead on
the other fellows.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hicksley acted like a game sport this afternoon
when he threw the ball down in the box instead of
handing it to you,” remarked Fred, with whom the
incident rankled.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, well,” said Bobby, “you must make some
allowance for him. It was natural that he should
feel sore.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That isn’t the point,” persisted Fred. “A
thoroughbred might have felt sore, but he wouldn’t
have shown it. I tell you, Bobby, you want to look
out for that fellow. If you could have seen the
way he looked at you while you were pitching.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Looks don’t hurt,” Bobby flung back carelessly.</p>

<p class='c008'>But a few days later an incident occurred which
showed that Hicksley was willing to go much
further than looks in his hatred of his rival.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was one of those unseasonably warm days
that sometimes come in the spring. Recitations
were being held in the classroom of Mr. Leith, the
head teacher, and in order to make the air cooler
the electric fan had been set going.</p>

<p class='c008'>The seats of Hicksley, Bronson and Jinks were
just behind those of Bobby and Fred, and were in
the rear of the room.</p>

<p class='c008'>The lessons were proceeding as usual, when suddenly
there was a crash, and something wet and
sticky and evil smelling was scattered over the
room. Almost all the boys got some of it, and a
large yellow splash showed against the immaculate
white shirt of Mr. Leith himself.</p>

<p class='c008'>Somebody had thrown an egg into the electric
fan! And it was a very old egg, as was proved by
the vile odor which spread through the classroom.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXIV' class='c009'>CHAPTER XXIV<br /> <br />AN UNDESERVED PUNISHMENT</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The whirling fan, going at tremendous speed,
had scattered the contents of the egg far and wide,
and hardly any one had escaped.</p>

<p class='c008'>For a moment there was a stunned silence.
Then a roar of laughter broke from the boys. To
them it seemed a capital joke.</p>

<p class='c008'>But Mr. Leith did not laugh. His black eyes
snapped and his face was pale with anger.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who did that?” he asked, as he took out his
handkerchief and wiped the smear from the bosom
of his shirt.</p>

<p class='c008'>Naturally there was no answer. The laughter
died out, and everything became as silent as the
grave.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Such conduct is subversive of all discipline,”
went on Mr. Leith in his stilted way and trying to
get control of his voice. “If the boy who did that
will confess, I will take that into account in the
punishment I shall lay upon him. But no matter
how long it takes, I am determined to find the culprit.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Still no answer.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well,” said Mr. Leith after waiting a moment,
“I see that I shall have to question each one of you
separately.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He called them up one by one, beginning at the
front of the room, and each one denied knowing
anything about it, Bobby among the rest. Then
he came last to Hicksley.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I didn’t do it,” said Hicksley; “but—”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then he stopped, as though he had gone further
than he intended.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But what?” queried the teacher sharply.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nothing,” mumbled Hicksley, in apparent confusion.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You were going to say something else,” said
Mr. Leith, “and I insist on knowing what it was.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Hicksley kept silent. He wanted to give the impression
that if he told anything it would have to
be dragged out of him against his will.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You had better tell me what you were going to
say,” snapped the teacher severely, “or it will be
the worse for you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t want to tell on anybody,” said Hicksley.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, then you know who threw it,” said Mr.
Leith, brisking up like a hound on the trail.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” replied Hicksley.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who was it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t want to tell.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who was it, I say?” thundered Mr. Leith in
exasperation.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Blake,” blurted out Hicksley, as though he
did not want to say it but had to yield to force.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bobby was thunderstruck, and for a minute the
room seemed to be whirling around him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It isn’t true,” he cried, recovering himself.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s a—a whopper!” shouted Fred fiercely.
“I was sitting right beside Bobby, and he didn’t
throw it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Keep quiet, Martin,” commanded Mr. Leith.
“Blake, come here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Bobby went forward and stood in front of the
desk.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why did you do a thing like that?” asked Mr.
Leith.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I didn’t do it,” replied Bobby stoutly. “I was
as surprised as any one else when it happened.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Leith beckoned to Fred.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You say that Blake didn’t throw it,” he said.
“Were you looking at him at the time?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“N-no, sir,” Fred had to confess, “I was looking
at the blackboard. But I know I’d have noticed
it if he had made any motion. Besides,” he
added in his attempt to help his friend, “if Bobby
had been going to do anything of that kind he’d
have told me beforehand.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That isn’t proof,” remarked the teacher;
“especially when Hicksley says that he actually
saw him do it. Do you still stick to that, Hicksley?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes sir,” answered Hicksley, who was scared
now at the tempest he had raised but had gone too
far to back out.</p>

<p class='c008'>But he carefully avoided meeting the blazing
eyes of Bobby.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Go to your seats,” Mr. Leith ordered.</p>

<p class='c008'>They obeyed, and as Hicksley sank down between
Bronson and Jinks, he whispered in a panic:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t forget that you fellows have got to stand
by me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Leith reflected for a moment.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did any one else see Blake throw the egg?” he
asked at length.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hicksley nudged his cronies and both raised
their hands.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I did,” came from both at once.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bobby half rose from his seat and Fred clenched
his fists.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s not so!” exclaimed Bobby.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The low-down skunks!” ejaculated Fred.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Leith quieted them with a gesture.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was a good man, and he tried to be just.
But he had been sorely tried by this breach of
discipline, and his dignity had received a severe
shock. He could not forget the glaring yellow
smear on his shirt front, and he felt that he had
been made a laughing stock before his class.</p>

<p class='c008'>He had always liked Bobby, who had stood high
in his lessons and whose behavior in class had always
been good. Yet it was possible that an impish
spirit of mischief had suddenly taken possession
of him, and that on the impulse of the moment
he might have taken refuge in denial.</p>

<p class='c008'>And there was the positive testimony of three
witnesses that they had actually seen Bobby throw
the egg. To be sure, he knew something of the
character of those witnesses, and against any one
of them he would have been inclined to take
Bobby’s word in preference. But he knew nothing
of the grudge the bullies held against Bobby,
and to a man of his upright character it was inconceivable
that three of them should make such a
charge if it were not true.</p>

<p class='c008'>He pondered the matter for several minutes,
while the class waited breathlessly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I shall look into this matter further,” he finally
announced; “but for the present, Blake, and
until the affair is cleared up, you are not to take
part in track sports or play on the baseball team.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXV' class='c009'>CHAPTER XXV<br /> <br />OFF FOR A SWIM</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Bobby sat as if stunned. There was bitter revolt
in his heart against the injustice of it all.
And, in addition, he felt as though he would like to
get at Hicksley and thrash him well.</p>

<p class='c008'>But for the moment he was helpless. The evidence
was against him, and he was too proud to
make any further protest or appeal to Mr. Leith.</p>

<p class='c008'>To the rest of the boys, the sentence came like a
clap of thunder. They were fond of Bobby and
believed he was telling the truth. They would
have been sorry to see him punished for any reason.
But it was not only the fact of the punishment,
but the nature of it, that filled them with
consternation. Bobby Blake off the ball team!
Where would Rockledge be now in the race for
the pennant of the Monatook Lake League?</p>

<p class='c008'>The lessons proceeded, but the class might as
well have been dismissed at once, for only one
thought filled the minds of all. And when at last
the gong rang, there was a rush for Bobby on the
campus, and a buzzing arose that resembled a hive
of angry bees.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was well for the bullies that, sitting on the
rear seats, they had slipped out of the door quickly
and disappeared. They would surely have come
to grief in the present excited condition of the
boys.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fred slammed his books so violently on the
ground that he broke the strap that held them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Just wait!” he stormed, “just wait! I’ll
pitch into that Tom Hicksley the minute I see him,
big as he is.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It would have been bad enough of him to tell,
even if Bobby had done it,” growled Mouser.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He ought to have his head knocked off,” raged
Skeets.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Swell chance now we’ll have of winning the
pennant,” groaned Shiner.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not a Chinaman’s chance,” mourned Pee Wee.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can see us coming in as tail-enders,” prophesied
Sparrow.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Was such a dirty trick ever heard of?” wailed
Billy Bassett, appealing to high heaven, as though
even in his grief he was asking the answer to a
riddle.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bobby had had time now to get a grip on himself,
and although his heart was hot within him,
he was outwardly the coolest of them all.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Tom Hicksley will pay for this all right,” he
declared. “Some time the truth will come out and
I hope it will be soon. I haven’t any doubt of
course that he did it himself. Then he got cold
feet when he saw how angry Mr. Leith was and
fibbed out of it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course, he’d fib out of it!” exclaimed Fred.
“Nobody who knows Tom Hicksley would expect
him to do anything else. But why did he put it
on you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Because he’s sore at me, I suppose,” Bobby
answered. “He’s always hated me since that
afternoon on the train.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, but he’s just as sore at the rest of us who
butted in, as he calls it,” persisted Fred. “It’s
something more than that, Bobby. It’s because
you saved the game when he had almost lost it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’s never forgiven you for that,” agreed
Mouser.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, whatever his reason was, I’m the goat all
right,” said Bobby, in a feeble attempt to put the
best face on the matter.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It isn’t only you, but it’s Rockledge that’s the
goat,” amended Sparrow. “We’ll be licked out
of our boots.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You fellows will have to play all the harder,”
said Bobby. “Mr. Leith may change his mind
when he comes to think it over. I have a hunch
that Hicksley isn’t going to get away with such a
whopper as that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’d like to have him by the throat and choke the
truth out of him,” snapped Fred wrathfully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It would be a pretty big job to get any truth
out of that fellow,” grunted Mouser.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What did the old weather want to go and get
so hot for all of a sudden?” burst out Pee Wee.
“If it hadn’t been for that, the fan wouldn’t have
been going and the whole thing wouldn’t have happened.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This kick against nature struck the boys as comical,
and the laugh that followed cleared the air
somewhat and relieved their excited feelings. But
for the rest of the day and evening, there was
but one topic that held the attention of any of
them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bobby felt blue and depressed. He would
rather have had any other penalty put on him than
to be ordered not to play on the team. The very
sight of his glove and uniform made him miserable.</p>

<p class='c008'>It would have been bad enough, even if he had
been guilty of that special bit of mischief. But
then he would have “taken his medicine” with as
good grace as possible. But it made him raging
angry to feel that he had been made the victim of
a contemptible plot by such a fellow as Tom
Hicksley.</p>

<p class='c008'>What made it still more exasperating was the
fact that he did not see any way to get at the real
truth. Hicksley had been on the rear row of
seats, and his only companions were Bronson and
Jinks, who were just as bad as himself. No one
but they had seen the egg thrown, if, as Bobby
felt sure, Hicksley had thrown it. And now that
they had put it on Bobby, they had to stand by the
falsehood. One was as deep in the mud as the
others were in the mire, and there was not a chance
in the world of their confessing.</p>

<p class='c008'>It hurt Bobby, too, to know that he rested under
a cloud in the eyes of Mr. Leith, who had practically
told him that afternoon that he did not believe
him. He was a truthful boy and it came
hard to have his word questioned.</p>

<p class='c008'>All the next morning he was gloomy and downhearted.
In the afternoon, Fred, like the loyal
friend he was, tried to get his mind off his troubles
by suggesting that they go swimming.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t let’s go to the lake this time,” said Fred.
“Let’s go to Beekman’s Pond up in the woods.
There’s a dandy place there for diving.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was a little early in the season yet for a
swim, but the warm weather, which still continued,
made the prospect an agreeable one. So, shortly
after dinner, having received permission to go
out of bounds, Bobby and Fred with half a dozen
of the other boys started out for the pond.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say, fellows,” asked Billy as they trudged
along, “what’s the dif—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“There goes the human question mark again,”
interrupted Mouser.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’s not to blame, he was born that way,” said
Skeets with large toleration.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Honestly, Billy,” chaffed Fred, “I don’t believe
you can say a single sentence that isn’t a
question.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Can’t I?” said Billy, a little nettled.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There! what did I tell you?” said Fred, trapping
him neatly.</p>

<p class='c008'>The boys roared, and even Billy grinned.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well,” he said, “I might as well have the game
as the name. What’s the difference—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Stop him, somebody,” cried Sparrow, wringing
his hands in pretended agony.</p>

<p class='c008'>Billy looked at him scornfully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, let him get it out,” said Bobby resignedly.
“Go ahead, Billy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Shoot,” said Fred.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s the difference,” asked Billy, “between
a fisherman and a lazy scholar?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ask Pee Wee,” replied Skeets. “He ought
to know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Pee Wee isn’t a fisherman,” objected Mouser.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who said he was?” retorted Skeets.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If you’re hinting that I’m a lazy scholar,” remarked
Pee Wee, “all I’ve got to say is that I’ll
never be lonesome among you boobs.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Stop your chinning,” said Billy, “and answer
my question.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“One catches fish and the other catches a licking,”
ventured Fred.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Each one sometimes finds himself in deep
water,” guessed Skeets.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No,” said Billy. “They’re not so bad, but
neither one’s the real answer.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Finally the boys gave it up.</p>

<p class='c008'>“One baits his hooks and the other hates his
books,” chirped Billy.</p>

<p class='c008'>A groan went up from the sufferers.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think that’s a pippin,” remarked Billy
proudly; “but I’ve got another one that’s better
still. Why is a—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sic the dog on him!” ejaculated Mouser.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s the use of letting him live?” asked
Fred.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He seems to be human, but is he?” queried
Sparrow.</p>

<p class='c008'>As Beekman’s Pond came in sight just then, they
broke into a run, and Billy had to save his masterpiece
for another time.</p>

<p class='c008'>They found a secluded spot, and with a whoop
and a shout were out of their clothes in a hurry.
Then with a shiver each took the plunge into the
clear waters of the pond.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXVI' class='c009'>CHAPTER XXVI<br /> <br />THE SCAR AND THE LIMP</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The chums came up shuddering, with hair plastered
over their faces and the water streaming
from their shoulders.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ugh,” sputtered Fred, “the water’s as cold as
ice!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A polar bear would like it,” chattered Skeets.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Turn on the hot water faucet, Jeems,” laughed
Bobby.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll be all right in a minute or two,” remarked
Sparrow.</p>

<p class='c008'>They swam around, racing and diving like so
many young porpoises, and in a little while the
blood returned to their chilled surfaces, making
them perfectly comfortable again.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Reminds you something of Plunkit’s Creek,
doesn’t it, Fred?” said Bobby.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” agreed Fred, “only this is a good deal
longer and wider than that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then, too, we haven’t got Ap here, watching
us from the bank and getting ready to set his dog
on us,” grinned Mouser.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We don’t owe Ap anything,” laughed Bobby.
“We paid him all up that day we made him walk
the plank.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you remember how he looked when he
struck the water?” chuckled Pee Wee.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wonder if he and Pat have met each other
since we came away,” said Bobby, as he recalled
the scene at the railway station on the morning
they left Clinton.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ap had better keep his whip handy,” observed
Fred.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That wouldn’t help him much,” returned
Bobby. “Pat would take it away from him and
wade into him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They had been in and out of the water for perhaps
an hour, when Bobby, who had swum down to
where the shore curved a little, suddenly turned
and swam back again as fast as he could.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come along with me, fellows,” he cried, “and
don’t make any more noise than you can help.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The others followed him wonderingly until they
reached the bend. Then, while they hid behind
some grasses, Bobby pointed to two men who were
lounging under a tree a short distance away.</p>

<p class='c008'>They were smoking stubby pipes as they lay at
their ease. Their faces were rough and unshaven
and their clothing dirty and ragged.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t see much to get excited about,”
remarked Shiner disappointedly. “Just a couple of
tramps.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“They’re more than that to us,” replied Bobby.
“They’re the very tramps who robbed us in that
old hut.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The boys were on edge in an instant. Just then
one of the men rose, stretched himself lazily and
took a few steps toward the tree. As he did so,
the boys saw that he had a perceptible limp.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And the other one has a scar on his face,”
whispered Bobby excitedly. “You can see it if
you look close.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They looked more closely, and Fred in his eagerness
rose a little too high. His red head caught
the eye of the man with the scar, and he uttered
a startled exclamation.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now you’ve, done it,” whispered Mouser disgustedly.
“Why didn’t you keep that red mop of
yours out of sight?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hurry, fellows,” urged Bobby. “We’ve got
to catch those fellows before they can get away.
Whip on your clothes and let’s get back after
them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The boys swam back as fast as possible and
rushed up on the bank.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who put a knot in the leg of my pants?” came
in a howl from Fred as he struggled desperately
to unfasten the knot.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’d like to catch the fellow who tied my socks
together,” growled Mouser.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And here’s one of my shoes floating in the
water,” wailed Skeets.</p>

<p class='c008'>They had to pay the penalty now of the tricks
they had played on one another, and they felt as
though they were in a nightmare as they tried
frantically to get into their clothes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“They’ll get away sure,” groaned Bobby.
“Hustle, fellows, hustle! Come along just as you
are if you can’t do any better.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He led the way, and the rest came stumbling
after him in all conditions of dress and undress.
Mouser had stuffed his stockings in his pocket,
Skeets carried his wet shoes in his hands, while
Fred, with one leg in his trousers, held up the rest
of the garment in his hand and made what speed
he could.</p>

<p class='c008'>But when they reached the tree under which
the tramps had been sitting, they found no one.
The birds had flown. They may possibly have recognized
Fred’s red head as that of one of their
victims, or they may have thought that he was one
of a company, including men, who might ask them
curious and troublesome questions. At any rate
they had quickly gotten out of sight.</p>

<p class='c008'>The boys searched about everywhere in that part
of the woods, but fruitlessly. Pee Wee fell into a
small excavation, this time barking his shins in
reality. But he had no other injury except to his
feelings, and his comrades hauled him out without
much trouble.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well,” said Fred at last, “there doesn’t seem
any more reason for hurry, and I guess I’ll get my
pants on.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And I’ll put on my shoes,” said Skeets, suiting
the action to the word. “This stubble has
hurt my feet something fierce.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mouser’s socks also took their rightful place,
and the boys began to feel more like human beings.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What would you have done anyway, Bobby, if
you’d found them under the tree?” asked Mouser.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know exactly,” answered Bobby
frankly. “Of course, we couldn’t tackle grown
men. But we could have kept them in sight until
we met some farmers and had them nabbed. Or
one of us could have gone back to Rockledge and
got the constable. But we know that they’re hanging
round in this neighborhood now, and we’ll tell
the constable about it and he’ll telephone to all the
towns near by to be on the lookout for them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I sure would like to get back my ring,” said
Fred longingly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Those sleeve buttons would look mighty good
to me,” chimed in Pee Wee.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I could use my scarf pin too,” added Mouser.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t <em>much</em> expect to see my watch again,”
said Bobby, “but there’s a <em>chance</em> of finding where
they pawned ’em if we can get those fellows arrested.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“There were only two of ’em,” mused Fred.
“I wonder where the other one was.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Round at some farmhouse begging for grub
maybe,” suggested Skeets.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Or in jail perhaps,” guessed Sparrow. “If
he isn’t, he ought to be.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’ll get there sooner or later,” said Fred,
“and so will the rest of the bunch.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The boys hurried back to town and put the matter
in the hands of the constable, who promised
that he would do all in his power to catch the
thieves. But the days passed into weeks with the
tramps still at liberty, and the chances of the boys
ever getting back the stolen articles became more
and more unlikely.</p>

<p class='c008'>But this did not hold such a place in their
thoughts as the race for the championship of the
Monatook Lake League, which kept getting hotter
and hotter as the various teams tried their
strength against each other.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was a case of nip and tuck. First one team
and then the other would forge to the front. By
the time the first five games had been played not
a single team could be said to be out of it.</p>

<p class='c008'>But what grieved the Rockledge boys was that
their bitter rival, Belden, although it started the
season with a defeat at the hands of Ridgefield,
had made a strong rally and was now in front with
a total of four victories and one lost game.
Somerset and Ridgefield were tied for second
place, while Rockledge—Rockledge, which had so
proudly counted on the pennant—was <em>last</em>!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXVII' class='c009'>CHAPTER XXVII<br /> <br />A GLEAM OF LIGHT</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>There was no trouble at all in finding out the
reason why Rockledge was the tail-ender. The
batting and fielding of the team was all that could
be asked for. Both in offense and defense they
had the edge on their rivals. The weakness lay in
the pitcher’s box.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was not that Hicksley did not work hard. He
had a double reason now for pitching at the top of
his speed, for he not only wanted to win the glory
to himself, but he wanted to show that the absence
of Bobby did not weaken the team.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the trouble with him was that, as a rule, he
could not last for the full nine innings. He would
go along like a house afire for the first half of the
game. Then about the fifth or sixth inning, he
would begin to falter, and in some one of the remaining
innings would “go up with a bang.”</p>

<p class='c008'>At such times there was no one to come to the
rescue, as in the first game that Bobby had pulled
out of the fire. Spentz, the right fielder, who knew
a little about twirling, had replaced him once but
had not been able to undo the damage. In the
game with Ridgefield, Hicksley had managed to
last long enough to win by one run, and in the second
game with Somerset had pitched fairly well,
though he lost. But Ridgefield had come back with
an easy victory, and Belden had fairly smothered
him under a shower of hits to every part of the
field. So that the outlook was very blue for Rockledge,
and the boys fairly squirmed under the
crowing of the Belden fellows whenever they met
them on the trolley or in the town.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If we only had Bobby in the box, we’d be going
along at the head of the procession,” groaned
Fred.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That yellow streak of Hicksley’s comes out in
almost every game,” growled Sparrow.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He can’t stand the gaff when it comes to a
pinch,” assented Skeets gloomily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“A fellow who would lie as he did about Bobby
doesn’t deserve to have any luck,” grunted Pee
Wee.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’s a hoodoo,” agreed Shiner. “But what
are we going to do?” he asked despairingly. “We
haven’t anybody else to take his place, now that
Bobby is out of it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Things were at this stage, when Bobby and Fred,
who had been on a trip to town, were caught on
their return in a terrific thunder storm. They
were lucky enough to find refuge in a culvert under
the railroad, and there they waited till the
storm had spent its fury.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was one of the worst storms they ever remembered,
and peal after peal of thunder shook the
earth, while streaks of jagged lightning shot across
the sky.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Scubbity-<em>yow</em>!” exclaimed Fred, after one particularly
violent clap of thunder, followed by a
blinding flash. “I’ll bet that hit around here
somewhere.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wouldn’t like to be near anything it hit,” replied
Bobby.</p>

<p class='c008'>The rain came down in torrents for some time
longer, but at last the storm abated, rifts of blue
sky appeared in the clouds, and the boys started
off toward the school.</p>

<p class='c008'>They were taking a short cut through the woods,
when they were startled at seeing a great tree,
that had been split from top to base, lying across
the path.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Jiminy Christmas!” exclaimed Bobby. “This
is what the lightning hit that time.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It made a clean job of it,” cried Fred. “But
listen,” he added, as muffled sounds came from the
great tangle of branches. “What’s making that
noise?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s somebody in there!” ejaculated Bobby, as
he peered through the green welter of boughs and
branches. “Quick, Fred, let’s get in there.”</p>

<p class='c008'>With much difficulty, they forced their way
through the tangle of foliage, until they were able
to see two dim figures crouching in the center of
the mass. Their surprise was great and became
still greater, when they recognized them as two of
the smaller of the Rockledge boys, Charlie White
and Jimmy Thacker.</p>

<p class='c008'>They were confused by their fright, and were
whimpering. They gave only broken and stammering
replies to the questions of their rescuers,
who had a good deal of work in getting them out
from the boughs that held them down.</p>

<p class='c008'>They were finally pulled out to the open air.
They were more frightened than hurt, although
they had a number of scratches and bruises where
the branches had swept against them in their fall.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How did you boys manage to be caught in
there?” queried Bobby and Fred in one breath.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We were standing under a tree while it was
raining,” answered Charlie, who was not quite
as upset as his companion, “when this other tree
was hit and fell over. We tried to run, but the
branches caught us before we could get away.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I thought sure we were going to get killed!”
whimpered Jimmy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t you fellows know that you ought never
to stand under a tree in a thunderstorm?” demanded
Fred.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We know it now,” returned Charlie; “and you
can be sure we’ll never do it again.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Are you much hurt?” asked Bobby anxiously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I guess not,” answered Charlie, “but we’ve
got lots of scratches.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let’s see if you can walk all right,” ordered
Bobby.</p>

<p class='c008'>They made the attempt, and although they were
wobbly and uncertain on their legs, all were relieved
to find that no bones had been broken.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’ll be all right as soon as you get over your
scare,” pronounced Fred.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It was mighty lucky for us that you two boys
came along,” said Jimmy gratefully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” added Charlie. “We were held down
by those heavy branches, and I don’t see how we
would have got out by ourselves.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“After this, Charlie,” said Jimmy, looking at
his companion, “we ought to tell Bobby all we
know about the fellow who threw that egg into the
electric fan.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Their hearers started as though they had been
shot.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who was it?” cried Fred excitedly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Out with it!” commanded Bobby.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXVIII' class='c009'>CHAPTER XXVIII<br /> <br />TOM HICKSLEY GETS A THRASHING</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The boys looked for a moment as though they
almost regretted having let the cat out of the bag.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come along, now,” urged Bobby eagerly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let’s have the whole story,” cried Fred.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It—it was Tom Hicksley,” Jimmy stammered.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I knew it,” cried Fred jubilantly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you know that, or are you only guessing?”
asked Bobby, wild with anxiety.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We <em>saw</em> him do it,” returned Charlie, who saw
now that the only thing left was to tell the whole
story.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We were going along the hall to Mr. Carrier’s
classroom that afternoon,” put in Jimmy, “and
the door into your room was open because the day
was so warm. We peeped in as we went by, and
we saw Hicksley take the egg out of his pocket and
throw it into the electric fan.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And why didn’t you tell about it before?”
asked Fred.</p>

<p class='c008'>“’Cause we were afraid that Hicksley would
lick us if we did,” confessed Jimmy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’s so much bigger than we are, and he
jumped on us once for nothing at all,” added
Charlie in self-defense.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s all right,” said Bobby, who was perfectly
willing to excuse them, now that he saw he
was going to be cleared. “We all know that he’s
a big bully and always picking on the little fellows.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You come right along with me,” said Fred, in
a masterful way. “You keep out of this, Bobby.
I’ll have this thing fixed up in a jiffy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Bobby was perfectly satisfied to leave the settlement
of the matter in the hands of his loyal
friend, and he went on to the dormitory, while
Fred headed the little procession that a few minutes
after marched into the office of Mr. Leith.</p>

<p class='c008'>What went on there was shown the following
morning after Mr. Leith had called his class to
order.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Blake,” he said, clearing his throat, “come up
here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Bobby went up and stood in front of the desk.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Blake,” went on Mr. Leith, “I did a great injustice
to you a few weeks ago, and I want to
apologize to you before the whole class. I have
found out the real culprit. I know the name of the
boy who threw the egg into the electric fan.”</p>

<p class='c008'>There was a buzz of wild excitement in the class,
and Hicksley, together with his two cronies, flushed
red and grew pale in turn.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That will do, Blake,” Mr. Leith went on.
“You may go to your seat.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Bobby retired, murmuring something, he did not
know what.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hicksley, come here,” commanded the teacher.
“And you, Bronson, and Jinks, come along.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The three of them, with shuffling steps and hang-dog
looks, walked slowly up the aisle.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hicksley,” said Mr. Leith severely, “you said
at the time this thing happened that you actually
saw Blake throw the egg. I do not want to condemn
you without your being heard, and I am
going to give you this chance to tell the truth.
Are you willing to stand by your statement, or do
you wish to take it back?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Hicksley hesitated for a moment and then decided
to bluff it out.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I did see him,” he muttered doggedly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Martin,” directed Mr. Leith. “Step to the
door and tell White and Thacker to come in.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Fred did as ordered and returned, bringing the
two small boys with him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Tell me now, boys, what you told me yesterday,”
the teacher commanded.</p>

<p class='c008'>They looked fearfully at Hicksley and his companions,
who shot threatening glances at them.
But they went ahead and related what they had
seen on the afternoon in question. The simple
story bore the mark of truth on its face and carried
conviction.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Leith dismissed them and turned to the three
in front of him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What have you to say to this?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='c008'>They kept silent, with their heads lowered, and
after a moment the teacher continued:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am not going to say anything more just now
to add to the shame you must be feeling. You are
all to report to Doctor Raymond in his study at
three o’clock this afternoon. That is all for the
present.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They stumbled back to their seats, avoiding the
contemptuous looks of their schoolmates. And
that afternoon at the hour named they had the
interview they dreaded with the head of the school.</p>

<p class='c008'>That interview was short, but quite long enough
to make their faces blanch and their hearts quake.
If Hicksley had been guilty simply of denying the
act as having been done by him, that would have
been bad enough, but the punishment would have
been lighter. But to try deliberately to put it on
another was unforgivable. Hicksley was dismissed
from the school and Bronson and Jinks
were suspended for the remainder of the term.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hicksley, boiling with rage, went to his room to
pack. On his way down to summon the expressman,
he met Bobby coming alone up the stairs.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hicksley saw his opportunity and plunged heavily
into Bobby, sending him stumbling backwards
down the stairs almost to the lower landing. Had
it not been for a wild clutch at the banister, Bobby
would have fallen flat on his back.</p>

<p class='c008'>All his fighting blood awoke at this unprovoked
assault. It was the last straw. He had been under
great restraint for the past few weeks while
the injustice done him had rankled sorely. He
clenched his fists, and as the bully reached the
landing he received a blow that drove his head
back and chased the malicious grin from his face.</p>

<p class='c008'>In a moment the two boys were fighting, hammer
and tongs. Hicksley was the larger but Bobby was
strong and as quick as a young wildcat. Besides,
he had no “yellow streak” in him.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXIX' class='c009'>CHAPTER XXIX<br /> <br />A WILD CHASE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Not five minutes had elapsed before Hicksley
was lying on the floor of the hall, holding his hand
to his eyes and nose.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Get up!” Bobby commanded.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hicksley did nothing but grunt.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Have you had enough?” asked Bobby.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Enough,” mumbled the bully, all the fight
taken out of him.</p>

<p class='c008'>He slunk away, while the boys, who had crowded
out into the hall at the sound of combat and had
viewed with rapture the defeat of the bully, gathered
about Bobby, who, except for a bruise on his
forehead, showed no sign of the battle.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bully for you, Bobby!” crowed Mouser.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Scubbity-<em>yow</em>!” howled Fred in delight.
“That was a peach of a scrap.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He got all that was coming to him,” exulted
Sparrow.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hicksley couldn’t lick a postage stamp!” exclaimed
Skeets gleefully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He must have learned to fight by mail,”
grinned Shiner.</p>

<p class='c008'>“A mighty good job you made of it, Bobby,”
commended Billy Bassett.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wasn’t looking for trouble,” explained
Bobby, “but when he butted into me and knocked
me down the stairs, I couldn’t help pitching into
him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>For the rest of that day and evening little else
was thought of or spoken of but the “trimming”
that Bobby had given to the bully. But apart
from the satisfaction of having Hicksley get what
he so richly deserved, a still greater joy was in
the hearts of all.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bobby Blake was back again on the team!</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now,” cried Fred, expressing the hope and
belief of all, “you’ll see Rockledge begin to
climb.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And Rockledge did climb with a vengeance.</p>

<p class='c008'>The very next Saturday with Bobby in the box
and pitching gilt-edged ball they walked all over
Belden, not only beating their chief rival but doing
it to the score of seven to nothing. The whole
team played behind their pitcher as though they
were inspired with new life. And from that time
on, the Beldenites drew into their shell and did
not do so much crowing when they met the Rockledge
boys in the town.</p>

<p class='c008'>But Bobby and his comrades knew that
they still had a heavy task before them, if they
were to win the pennant of the Monatook Lake
League.</p>

<p class='c008'>Belden had now won four games and lost two.
Rockledge was even in gains and losses, having
won three and lost three. If there had been many
more games to play, Rockledge would have felt
much more confident, for she was now traveling
faster than her rival. But the end of the season
was coming fearfully close, and there were only
three more games to play.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Belden is the one we’ve got to beat,” declared
Frank. “We’ve got the Indian sign, I think, on
Somerset and Ridgefield.”</p>

<p class='c008'>As far as Ridgefield was concerned, this seemed
true, for Rockledge won the game by four to two,
his mates handing Bobby a lead in the first inning
that he was able to keep throughout the game.
But as Belden also won on the same day from
Somerset, though after a harder battle, the Rockledge
boys were still “trailing” the school across
the lake.</p>

<p class='c008'>The excitement now was reaching fever pitch,
and it broke all bounds the following Saturday,
when Belden came a cropper with Ridgefield, being
“nosed out” in the ninth by a sudden rally
on the part of their opponents, while Rockledge
won handily from Somerset in a free batting game
by ten runs to six.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hurrah!” yelled Mouser, “we’re tied with Belden
now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bobby has pulled us up in dandy shape,” declared
Frank. “You’re a wonder, Bobby, old
scout.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Just keep it up for one more game, Bobby,”
pleaded Sparrow.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Scubbity-<em>yow</em>!” shouted Fred. “I’ll bet old
Belden is shaking in its boots.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Somerset and Ridgefield had played good ball
in spots, but now they were out of the race. Belden
and Rockledge had each won five and lost
three, and the game that was to be played between
them on the following Saturday would wind up the
season and decide which of the teams was to win
the pennant of the Monatook Lake League.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was almost impossible for the boys to keep
their minds on their lessons, but as there were only
ten days remaining in the school term this did not
matter to the same degree as it would have done
earlier in the year.</p>

<p class='c008'>But an incident occurred on the Monday following
the game with Somerset that gave a new
slant to their thoughts, and for a few hours drove
even thoughts of the pennant from the minds of
Bobby and his friends.</p>

<p class='c008'>Shiner had been invited to go for an automobile
ride by a friend of his family, who was staying
for a few days at Rockledge. He came rushing
into the dormitory with his eyes bulging.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say, fellows!” he gasped, “if you want to
catch those tramps of yours, come along with
me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What do you mean?” his chums asked in
chorus, as they made a wild grab for their hats.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve seen them,” panted Shiner. “But come
along and I’ll tell you. Hustle!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The boys rushed downstairs to find an automobile
waiting. Beside Mr. Wharton, the owner,
they recognized the constable.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Tumble in,” said Mr. Wharton, smiling, and
a half dozen boys swarmed into the automobile.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You see,” explained Shiner, “we passed three
tramps about two miles from here, and I saw that
two of them were the ones we saw the day we were
swimming. I told Mr. Wharton and we put on
speed, picked up the constable and hurried up
for you, so that you could go along and identify
them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Wharton had started the car the moment
the boys were inside, and it was skimming along
like a bird. It went so fast that the boys had to
hold on to their caps, and although they were all
chattering with might and main, the wind made it
almost impossible for one to hear what the others
were saying.</p>

<p class='c008'>In a very few minutes they saw three figures on
the lonely country road ahead. The one in the
center had a limp that was familiar.</p>

<p class='c008'>The tramps heard the coming car, and at first
stood aside to let it pass. But as it slowed up on
approaching them, they took alarm, climbed over
a fence and started across the fields toward a piece
of woodland a little way off.</p>

<p class='c008'>Their pursuers leaped from the car and gave
chase. The lithe limbs of the boys gave them an
advantage over their heavier companions, and
they were soon on the heels of the tramps, who
turned snarling and faced them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Keep off or I’ll club the life out of you,”
shouted one, whom they recognized as the man
with the scar.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No you won’t,” cried Bobby, defiantly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We want the things you stole from us,” sang
out Fred.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Jail for yours!” Mouser shouted.</p>

<p class='c008'>They circled round the men, thus holding them
in check, and in another moment Mr. Wharton and
the constable had come up and each grabbed one
of the men by the collar. At the sight of the constable’s
star, the other quickly wilted.</p>

<p class='c008'>The officer slipped handcuffs on them all and
pushed them into the ear, while the boys crowded
in as best they could, two of them standing on
the running-board. In triumph, they went back
to town and the men were placed in jail.</p>

<p class='c008'>First they were searched, and, greatly to the
boys’ delight, pawn tickets were found that accounted
for all the articles that had been stolen
from them. The money of course was gone, but
the boys cared little for that, as long as they were
sure that they could get back their cherished personal
possessions.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’re some demon thief catchers, all right,”
chuckled Mouser.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He would call me red-head, would he?”
grinned Fred, referring to the scar-faced tramp.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It means good luck for us, fellows,” declared
Bobby. “Now, I’m <em>sure</em> we’re going to down Belden.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXX' class='c009'>CHAPTER XXX<br /> <br />WINNING THE PENNANT—CONCLUSION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Belden had its own idea as to who was to be
“downed,” and almost the whole school went
to Rockledge with colors flying on the great day
that was to decide who should carry off the flag
of the Monatook Lake League.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the teams had each played a game on the
other’s grounds, it had been left to the toss of a
coin as to where the deciding game should take
place, and Rockledge had won.</p>

<p class='c008'>This was a good omen in itself, and the Rockledge
boys were chock-full of confidence, as they
slipped into their baseball suits in the gymnasium
before going on the field.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ve just <em>got</em> to win to-day, Fred,” remarked
Bobby. “It would never do to lose with all our
folks in the stand looking on.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You bet we’ll win,” replied Fred emphatically.
“If we don’t, I’ll hunt up some hole, slip in and
pull the hole in after me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. and Mrs. Blake had come down on this last
day. Fred’s father and mother were also
present, accompanied by Betty. And to give the boys
a pleasant surprise they had brought Scat Monroe
and Pat Moriarty along with them.</p>

<p class='c008'>The weather had been a little threatening in the
morning, but about noon it cleared beautifully.
A great crowd was present, for all the towns near
Monatook Lake had become interested in the pennant
fight, and people came in droves to see the
deciding game.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bobby and Fred went up in the stand for a little
chat with their friends and families before the
game began.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I’m so glad it’s such a beautiful day!”
exclaimed Betty gleefully. “I was so afraid the
rain would come down this morning.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You wouldn’t expect the rain to go up, would
you?” asked her brother airily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Smarty!” said Betty, and she made a little face
at him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Fred had better behave himself or we’ll say
‘snowball’ to him, won’t we, Betty?” laughed
Bobby.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m rooting for you boys to win to-day,” remarked
Pat, his freckled face wreathed with
smiles.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’re going to fight like the mischief to do
it,” returned Bobby.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Put the whitewash brush on them,” said Scat.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Perhaps that’s asking a little too much,”
grinned Fred. “We’ll be satisfied with the big
end of the score.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Their parents smiled on them fondly and urged
them to do their best to win for Rockledge, and
the boys went down on the field with their hearts
full of determination.</p>

<p class='c008'>But it was evident from the moment the first
ball went over the plate that it would be no easy
task for either side to win. Each team was
screwed to the highest pitch and full of determination
and enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bobby started out like a winner. His arm had
never felt better, and he whipped the ball over
the plate at a speed that delighted the spectators—always
excepting the Belden rooters—but that
made Frank Durrock a little anxious.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Easy there, Bobby,” he counseled from first
base, when the first batter had gone out on strikes.
“The game’s young yet, and you’ve a long way
to go.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Bobby realized the wisdom of this, and made the
next batter pop up an infield fly to Mouser at
second. Then he mixed in a slow one that seemed
easy enough to hit as it came floating up to the
plate, but which resulted in an easy roller to the
box which Bobby had plenty of time to throw to
first.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s what you call a change of pace, old
scout,” congratulated Sparrow, as the nine came
in from the field amid a general clapping of hands
at the promising beginning.</p>

<p class='c008'>But Bobby was not to carry off the pitching
honors of the game without a struggle. Larry
Cronk, the Belden pitcher, was in splendid form,
and he had had the benefit of being coached by his
brother, who was a student at Yale and a member
of the Varsity team. The result of this training
was shown in a new “hop” ball that Larry
sprung on them for the first time. It came singing
over the plate with a jump on it just before
it reached the batter that at first puzzled the Rockledge
boys completely. Two of them struck out
and the third was an easy victim on a foul.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now it was Belden’s turn to howl. And howl
they did.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bobby’s got his work cut out for him to-day,”
remarked Sparrow to Skeets, as they went out into
the field.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s just the time Bobby’s at his best,” returned
Skeets confidently.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bobby’s got that fadeaway of his when it
comes to the pinch,” added Mouser, “and I’ll back
that against Larry’s hop any time.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Bobby was not daunted by this showing on the
part of his opponent. But he knew that he must
not slow down for a second. He must put brains
in his work as well as muscle, must study and outguess
the batters and give them just what they
did not want.</p>

<p class='c008'>So he worked with exceeding care, mixing up his
curves and his fast and slow balls so skillfully that
in the first four innings only two hits were made
off him, and one of them a scratch, and no one got
as far as second base. And in doing this he nursed
his strength, so that he felt almost as strong and
fresh as at the beginning.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Talk about a fox,” chuckled Fred, “he isn’t
in it with Bobby.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Larry, too, had kept any one from denting the
home plate, but he was so exultant over the success
of his new delivery that he relied upon it almost
entirely. And by and by the Rockledge boys
began to find him more easily than they did at
first. They had not yet made more than one clean
hit, but the bat was beginning to meet the ball
more solidly and it was only a matter of a little
time before they would be lining out base hits,
unless Larry changed his style and mixed in his
other curves.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll straighten them out in the next inning,
see if we don’t,” remarked Spentz confidently.</p>

<p class='c008'>And so they did. Spentz himself led off with
a crashing three-bagger to right. Fred brought
him home with a sizzling single and stole second
on the next ball pitched. Larry tightened up then,
and although a clever sacrifice bunt put Fred on
third, he was left there, as the next two batters
went out on strikes.</p>

<p class='c008'>Belden’s half had been scoreless, so that the end
of the fifth inning found Rockledge in the lead by
one to none. And in such a close game as this
promised to be, that one run looked as big as a
mountain.</p>

<p class='c008'>But by the time Belden’s sixth inning was over,
the Rockledge rooters were in a panic.</p>

<p class='c008'>The trouble began when Frank Durrock, old reliable
Frank, muffed an easy fly that ordinarily
he would have “eaten up.” Not only did he drop
the ball, but he let it get so far away from him
that the batter took a chance of making second.
Frank, in his haste to catch him, threw the ball
over Mouser’s head into left field, and before it
could be recovered, the runner had made the circuit
of the bases.</p>

<p class='c008'>The error seemed to demoralize the whole team.
Sparrow booted a grounder, and by the time he
had got through fumbling, it was too late to throw
to first. Spentz, in right, dropped a high fly and
then threw wildly to head off the runner, who was
legging it for third. The ball went ten feet over
Sparrow’s head and both boys scored, making the
count three to one in favor of the visitors. Rockledge
had a bad case of “rattles.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Bobby walked down to first as though he wanted
to talk to Frank, but really to give his mates time
to recover.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Play ball!” shouted the Belden rooters.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bobby took his time in returning, and even when
he was back in the box found a shoe lace that
needed tying. Not until he was fully ready did
he straighten up.</p>

<p class='c008'>He put on all speed now and disposed of the
next batters in order, two on high fouls and one
on strikes. He did not want to let any balls go
far out, in the present nervous conditions of his
mates.</p>

<p class='c008'>As for them, they were full of rage and self-reproach.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Three runs without a single hit!” groaned
Frank.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Never mind, fellows!” cried Bobby cheerily.
“Go right in now and get them back again. Knock
the cover off the ball.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But this was more easily said than done. Once
in that inning and again in the seventh and eighth,
they got men on the bases, but they could not bring
them in. In the eighth inning a rattling double
play brought groans from the Rockledge rooters,
as they saw a promising rally nipped in the bud.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bobby had been mowing the Belden boys down
almost as fast as they came to the plate. He had
brought out his fadeaway now and mixed it in so
well with the others that the batters never had a
chance. His mates had recovered their nerve and
were backing him up splendidly. Nevertheless the
fact still faced them that their rivals were two runs
ahead.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the ninth inning, after disposing of Belden,
Rockledge went in to do or die. Yells of encouragement
came from their partisans as they made
their last stand.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Go to it, boys!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You can beat them yet!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Never say die!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Rockledge! Rockledge! Rockledge!”</p>

<p class='c008'>But the shouts turned to groans, when Willis,
who was playing center field in place of Bronson,
put up a skyscraper which Cronk gobbled up without
moving in his tracks. Barry sent a hot
grounder to short which was fielded cleverly and
sent to first ahead of the batter. There was a
movement in the stand, as the spectators got ready
to leave.</p>

<p class='c008'>But they stopped short when Spentz sent a
screaming hit to center for a clean single. Frank
followed with a grasser between short and second
that gave him first and sent Spentz to third.
Larry faltered and gave Fred his base on balls.
The bases were full when Bobby came to the bat.</p>

<p class='c008'>Larry eyed him narrowly and wound a fast one
about his neck, at which Bobby refused to bite.
The next was right in the groove, and Bobby
caught it square on the end of his bat and sent it
whistling over the head of the first baseman. It
rolled clear to the right field fence, and before it
could be recovered, the Rockledge runners had
gone round the bases like so many jack rabbits,
and had jumped on the home plate, while Bobby
pulled up at second.</p>

<p class='c008'>The game was over, the game was won and the
Rockledge boys were the champions of the Monatook
Lake League!</p>

<p class='c008'>Bobby’s comrades rushed upon him, mauling
and pounding him; the shouting crowd swooped
out from the stand and surrounded him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Champions!” “Champions!” “Champions!”
they yelled, until their throats were husky and
their lungs were sore.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was a long time before Bobby could get
through the crowd to where his visitors awaited
him. There Betty cried one minute and laughed
the next, in her happy excitement. Mrs. Blake’s
eyes, too, were moist as she hugged her boy, and
Mr. Blake cleared his throat as he put his hand
on Bobby and told him he was proud of him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fred, too, came in for his share of well-earned
praise and the boys were happy beyond words.
And Scat and Pat were almost as delighted as
though they had won the game themselves.</p>

<p class='c008'>Finally, when matters were somewhat quieted
down, some one asked the boys about their plans
for the summer vacation. How full that summer
proved to be of stirring and exciting adventure
will be told in the next volume of this series.</p>

<p class='c008'>But just now all their thoughts were of the present.
Their school term was over. There had
been some unpleasant features, but in the main
their experiences had been happy ones.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We did it, Bobby!” exclaimed Fred joyfully,
for perhaps the twentieth time.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We got there,” agreed Bobby; “but it was a
mighty hard fight.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s what makes it all the more worth winning,”
Fred declared.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” said Bobby, “I guess the things that
come easy aren’t worth much. That’s what makes
us feel so good about being champions. For there
wasn’t anything easy about winning the pennant
of the Monatook Lake League.”</p>

<p class='c017'>In the boys’ world of story books, none better than those about boy
scouts arrest and grip attention. In a most alluring way, the stories in
the BOY SCOUT LIFE SERIES tell of the glorious good times and wonderful
adventures of boy scouts.</p>

<p class='c017'>All the books were written by authors possessed of an intimate knowledge
of this greatest of all movements organized for the welfare of boys, and
are published with the approval of the National Headquarters of the Boy
Scouts of America.</p>

<p class='c017'>The Chief Scout Librarian, Mr. F. K. Mathiews, writes concerning them:
“It is a bully bunch of books. I hope you will sell 100,000 copies of
each one, for these stories are the sort that will help instead of hurt
our movement.”</p>
